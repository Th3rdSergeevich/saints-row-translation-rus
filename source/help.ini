If an opponent walks over the chain, that chain is added to their total. The number of chains held by a person is indicated by a number over their head.

You score points based on how many chains you have on you when you drop them off. The more chains you have (to a maximum of ten), the more points you score.  Be careful, if you die while holding multiple chains you will drop them all. The drop-off location changes periodicallly. \n\n  The BAC HUD displays the point totals for the teams or players, the number of chains you're carrying and the amount of time before the drop-off point changes location, and the amount of time left in the match.\n\nThe team (or player) that reaches the score limit is the winner.

Once you have earned enough money to upgrade your team car, drive it to the Chop Shop, which is indicated on the mini map.  Doing so will upgrade your team car to the next level...but be careful, if the rival team destroys your team's car, its Bling level will drop by one.\n\n   Once your team car has been upgraded to level 4, drive it to the victory area and protect it for set duration to win.\n\n  If neither team has won the game by the time the counter reaches zero, the team with the highest level car wins.  If both teams are tied, the game enters sudden death.  In sudden death, the first team to either destroy their opponent's car or level up their own wins the match.\n\n NOTE:  Your car can not be destroyed while parked at your starting garage. There are two exceptions to this rule: \n\n A: Once your team car has reached level 4 it can always be destroyed \n\n B: Once the game is in sudden death your car can always be destroyed.
