VOC_LIN_WR1PHONE1_1=Hey, this is Lin.  Meet me at the arena parking lot, we gotta start making a move against the Rollerz.\n5300
# Just a Girl
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_1=That's a sweet ride Lin.\n2200
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_1=Uh huh.\n1000
VOC_WMWR_WR1CUT1_1=Who tuned it for ya?\n1300
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_2=No one, I did it myself.\n2700
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_2=The spoiler looks like Donnie's work.\n1900
VOC_WMWR_WR1CUT1_2=No way, that underglow screams Ricky Liu.\n2100
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_3=Yeah, I guess it does.\n1200
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_3=What is this, fuckin' third grade?\n2600
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_4=Whaddya mean?\n1200
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_4=Forget it, I'll see ya tomorrow.\n2300
VOC_WMWR_WR1CUT1_3=Dude, she totally wants you.\n3000
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_5=Assholes.\n1500
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_6=I swear to God, we're not going to be able to kill these bastards fast enough.\n5100
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_7=Aside from macho bullshit, I haven't heard much.  The only interesting news I got is that a shipment of high performance cars is coming in today.  It's not much, I know, so we're gonna make the best of it.  Jack the truck carrying the cars before it makes its delivery and take it to Samson.  He'll load up the cars with a few surprises, then finish the delivery.  Now get outta here before someone sees us.\n23300
VOC_SAMSON_WR1END_1=Nice work.  I'll rig these babies up and finish the delivery.  The Rollerz are gonna be in for a hell of a surprise.
# Turning on the Heat
VOC_LIN_WR2PHONE1_1=Come to the nightclub. Samson's done workin' on those cars, and we gotta talk about what we're gonna do with 'em.\n6000
VOC_LIN_WR2CUT1_1=Try not to look so conspicuous.\n3600
VOC_LIN_WR2CUT1_2=You did good, but I'm not through with you yet.  Those cars you stole have been rigged to blow once the engine reaches a high enough temperature.  I need you to make sure those cars get nice and hot.  There's a race going down in Chinatown tonight, and I think you should give them some tough competition.  I know these guys.  If you're in the lead for the final stretch, they're gonna hit the nitrous to blow past you.  When they do, boom.  As soon as those cars are wrecked, get the hell outta there.  You're no good to us dead.\n30100
VOC_LIN_WR2CUT1_3=Thanks for the dance.  Now hurry up, you got a race to win.\n5100
TROY_WR2_INTRO_1=Hey man, let's get to the race...look, I don't care what Lin says, you get me next to those cars and I'll take care of the Rollerz, to hell with this lap-race bullshit.\n8500
VOC_TROY_CARCHAT_1=I don't like the idea of Lin going undercover, you roll with people long enough and pretty soon you start thinkin' like 'em...\n5800
VOC_TROY_CARCHAT_2=Alright, here they are...I hope Lin followed up on her end of the deal...\n3700
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_1=Quit playin' around, we got work to do...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_2=Do you gotta do that?
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_3=Knock that shit off, this car's gotta be in good condition to win the race...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_4=The fuck you do that for?
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_5=Shit man, be more careful...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_6=Don't pull that shit in the Row...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_7=Quit fucking around...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_8=Come on, that shit ain't necessary...
VOC_TROY_WR2CARBLOWUP_1=That didn't look fun...
VOC_TROY_WR2CARBLOWUP_2=The kid needed thicker skin...
VOC_TROY_WR2CARBLOWUP_3=Lin doesn't fuck around, does she...
VOC_TROY_WR2CLOSER_1=You gotta get closer...
VOC_TROY_WR2CLOSER_2=Get me next to that fucker....
VOC_TROY_WR2CLOSER_3=Pull up to that Roller...
VOC_TROY_WR2COMPLETE_1=Good work man, all we can do now is sit tight and wait for Lin...\n4300
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_1=Yeah, I don't think they're too happy...
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_2=Let's get the hell outta here man!
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_3=We gotta get back to the Row!
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_4=Come on, shake these assholes!
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_5=Once we're back in the Row these bitches can't touch us...
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_6=That was too easy...
VOC_TROY_WR2PHONE_1=Hey, come to the church and pick me up, I wanna see if those trust fund babies can match their rep...\n4000
VOC_TROY_WR2RACE_1=Once the race starts, make sure you get me close to those assholes...\n3900
VOC_TROY_WR2RETURNROW_1=I think that pissed 'em off, we gotta get back to the Row...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_1=Come on, I thought you Rollerz knew how to race!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_10=Oh, come on, you can do better than that...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_11=I don't wanna hear any bitching when you gotta give me your parents' car...\n3300
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_12=See ya, chump...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_13=You didn't know who you were fucking with, did ya?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_14=You never had a chance...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_15=Don't even bother tryin' to catch up!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_16=I knew you Rollerz were all talk...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_17=You don't really think you can win, do you?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_18=You're outta your league, kid!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_19=You Rollerz are a fuckin' joke!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_2=That the best you got?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_20=Watching a movie about street racers doesn't make you a tuner, buddy!\n3500
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_3=Be sure to have your slip ready...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_4=Hey, be careful with my car...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_5=Tell ya what, you ask nicely and I'll let you wash my car on weekends...\n4500
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_6=You think you can beat us in that piece of shit?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_7=Go back to the suburbs, you prep school muthafucka!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_8=You shoulda stayed home...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_9=If I knew racing you chumps was this easy, I woulda took your slip months ago...\n4200
# Undercover
VOC_WMYNG_WR3CUT1_1=Need a light?\n2000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT1_1=Thanks.\n1000
VOC_WMYNG_WR3CUT1_2=Fuckin' asshole.\n1500
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT1_2=I tell ya, you and me are always making new friends. Things are moving too slow.  We gotta step it up.  I hear a guy named Joseph Price calls the shots.  I don't know much about him 'cept that he's friends with some mechanic named Donnie.   If we get in good with Price's crew, we'll always be one step a head of those fuckers.  Here's the plan.  Go and tear up Donnie's shop.  Right when you're about to finish off Price's buddy, I'll rush in and save the day.  Make it look good, but don't you dare mess up my car.  If we're lucky, Donnie will arrange a meet with Price.  Thanks for buying my tea.\n35600
VOC_DONNIE_WR3SPOT_1=Oh fuck me!
# The Sleeper
VOC_LIN_WR3PHONE1_1=Meet me at the tea house in Chinatown.  I think I got a way to get in deeper with the Rollerz.\n5100
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_1=Donnie, get down!\n2000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_2=What are you waitin' for? Get in!\n1700
VOC_DONNIE_WR3CUT2_1=We gotta get out of here!\n2000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_3=I think you scratched my hood.\n2200
VOC_DONNIE_WR3CUT2_2=Look, I--\n1000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_4=Mother fucker.\n2000
VOC_DONNIE_WR3CUT2_3=Who are you?\n1000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_5=I'm Lin, and you're welcome.\n4400
# Meet Uncle Will
VOC_LIN_WR4PHONE1_1=I'm in.  Donnie's setting up a meeting with the higher-ups of the Rollerz.  You should stop by and listen to what's being said.  I'll text you the address.\n8000
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_1=So he's okay?  That's great.\n2800
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT1_1=Yes, how could we possibly score dime bags without him?\n3800
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_2=Oh come on, Uncle Will, he's not that--\n1300
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_1=Sup Price?\n1600
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_3=You scared the shit outta me, Donnie.\n2100
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_2=I scared the shit outta me.\n2100
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT1_2=Donnie, it's always a pleasure when you bring strangers into my house.\n4500
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_3=Aw fuck, I forgot, this is--\n1800
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_1=I'm Lin.\n1000
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_4=She totally saved my ass Mr. Sharp, she's a helluva driver.\n3700
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_2=I'm the best racer that ever came out of Chinatown.\n2900
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_4=How come I've never heard of you?\n1500
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_3=Cause I got tits.\n1800
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_5=Is that what you call those?\n2000
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_6=Suppose I deserved that.\n1800
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_4=Yeah, you did.\n1200
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT1_3=My nephew has a...unique sense of humor.\n4700
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_5=That was supposed to be funny?\n1800
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_7=I thought it was, until you hit me in the face.\n2300
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_5=Yeah, then it was hilarious.\n2900
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT1_4=Joseph, you better hurry.  You don't want to miss your meeting.\n3400
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT1_8=Sorry, I gotta take off.  Lin, it was nice meeting you.  I'll catch you later Donnie.\n5800
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_6=So we're finally hitting that convoy huh?\n2600
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT1_5=I don't know what you're talking about, Donnie.\n2900
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_7=Sure you--\n700
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT1_6=I don't know what you're talking about, Donnie.\n3700
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_8=Oh... Riiight.  Just sit tight, Price should be back soon.\n4400
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT1_7=As stimulating as this conversation is, I'm afraid I need to make some calls.  If you'd excuse me.\n8800
# Focus
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_1=Ya know what I hate?  Underglow.  That shit is tacky as hell.\n5900
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_1=Whatever, I think--\n1500
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT2_1=They all got away?\n1700
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT2_1=That's what the word is.\n1000
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT2_2=How did this happen?\n1400
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT2_2=A crew from Saint's Row fucked up our boys.\n3100
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT2_3=Who?\n800
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_2=The same guys who fucked up my shop, I think they're the Fifth Street Alter Boys or somethin'.\n3600
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_2=The 3rd Street Saints.\n2600
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_3=What she said.\n900
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT2_3=Will you stop smoking that shit?  I need you to focus.\n3000
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_4=If you need me to focus, I'd pass that shit back.  (coughs)\n4600
VOC_SHARP_WR4CUT2_4=Donnie, do we have to have another... conversation?\n5100
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_5=Alright alright.  You got some time before the buyers need those parts right?\n4200
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_3=The buyers?\n1200
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_6=Oh, they're a bunch of guys overseas that Mr. Sharp kn--\n2600
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT2_4=Donnie...\n700
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_7=Sorry.\n900
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT2_5=Don't worry 'bout it, just think.\n1900
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_8=Give me some time.  I bet Lin and I can whip somethin' up.\n3100
VOC_PRICE_WR4CUT2_6=Okay, you game for that, Lin?\n2600
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_4=Hey, anything I can do to help.\n2400
# Thinking Outside the Box
VOC_LIN_WR5PHONE1_1=Stopping those hijackings really fucked things up for the Rollerz.  They got a whole list of cars that they're plannin' on jackin'.  Make sure they can't find what they're looking for.\n9400
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_1=I know he's your friend, Joseph, but I will not let that nimrod ruin my plans.\n5600
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT1_1=Your plans?\n1700
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_2=Our plans.\n2000
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT1_2=Look, Donnie may be a little flaky, but he always steps up at the end.\n4500
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_3=I certainly hope so.\n1800
VOC_DONNIE_WR5CUT1_1=Lin and I got this shit down.\n2400
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_4=This should be compelling.\n1900
VOC_DONNIE_WR5CUT1_2=Alright kids, check this shit out.  So we lost the parts the buyers wanted, and there's no way another shipment like that is going to roll through here again any time soon.  Lin and I did the math, and there are a couple key cars that we can strip down to get the parts we need.\n15100
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT1_3=See, what'd I tell ya?  This guy's a fucking genius. I'm gonna go get the boys ready.\n5800
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_5=So your plan is to go steal cars.  You really know how to think outside the box, Donnie.\n7000
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_1=Don't talk to him like that.\n1600
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_6=I'll take your advice to heart.\n2100
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_2=It's not advice.\n1300
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_7=A threat?  How refreshing.\n3400
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_3=Listen up, you--\n600
VOC_DONNIE_WR5CUT1_3=Lin, (stutters) don't worry 'bout--\n1600
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_8=Shut up, Donnie.\n1700
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_4=(Sharp and Lin)Shut up, Donnie.\n1700
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_9=You were saying?\n1500
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_5=I was about to tell you to go fuck yourself.\n2500
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_10=And here I thought we were bonding.\n3300
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_6=Let's go, Donnie.\n1000
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT1_11=That's probobly the smartest thing you've said all day.\n3900
# I'll Handle This
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_1=Donnie, slow down...don't worry about it, it wasn't your fault...I know you are, it's okay...just relax man...yeah, you do that...later.\n11300
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_2=FUCK!\n1000
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_1=That was productive.\n1500
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_3=That's the second time the Saints fucked us!\n2100
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_2=Three times, if you count the attack on the garage.  Quite a coincidence...\n5700
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_4=Whaddya mean?\n900
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_3=Well, let's think.  The same four people knew about those jobs.  If I didn't sell us out, and you didn't sell us out, who else is there?\n10600
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_5=Donnie?  Donnie may not like it when things get messy, but there's no way he'd turn on me...\n4900
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_4=Which brings us to...\n1800
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_6=Lin.\n800
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_5=Bravo.\n1900
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_7=This is gonna be a bitch to explain to Donnie.\n2900
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_6=Luckily, you're not going to.\n3800
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_8=Whaddya mean?\n1300
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_7=Please, you're too attached to the boy.  I'll handle this.\n5800
VOC_PRICE_WR5CUT2_9=I don't give a shit what you do to Lin, but you better not hurt Donnie.\n3900
VOC_SHARP_WR5CUT2_8=Of course, Joseph. I'll keep that in mind.\n4900
# Merry Christmas, Mr. Sharp
VOC_JULIUS_WR6CUT1_1=Sup, playa?\n1200

VOC_SHARP_WR6CUT2_1=Let's take our guests for a ride, shall we?\n2800
# Breaking Up Is Hard To Do...
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_1=Hey, I think we stopped moving.  Are you listening?  Are you even alive?  Say something!\n7200
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_2=Ow!  I'll take that as a yes.  Where the fuck's my lighter...\n4200
VOC_DONNIE_WR7CUT_1=What are you doing driving Lin's ride, Mr. Sharp?\n2900
VOC_SHARP_WR7CUT_1=I'm glad you could make it, Donnie.  There's something I want you to see.\n5000
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_3=Stay calm, we're gonna get outta this.\n2500

VOC_SHARP_WR7CUT_2=Take a deep breath and count to ten, Donnie.\n3000
VOC_DONNIE_WR7CUT_4=Count to ten?  You just shot my girl!\n3200

VOC_SHARP_WR7CUT_6=Children.\n1000
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_5=Hey... stay... stay calm.  We're gonna get outta this.\n5600
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_6=I... I think I found my lighter.\n4900
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_7=Did you hear that asshole Donnie?  He said I was his girl.\n6600
VOC_SHARP_WR7ATTACK_1=I won't let you ruin what I built!
VOC_SHARP_WR7ATTACK_2=This time, I'm making sure you're dead!

# Martyrs 
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_1=Did ya catch the news?  Looks like they found Lin's body floating in the river this morning.  Sorry, dawg.  I know you did everything you could.\n7300
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_2=Johnny's gonna take it pretty hard when he finds out, and you can bet yo' ass that he's gonna be callin' for blood.\n6000
VOC_PRICE_WR8CUT1_1=Listen up, people. We're done dicking around with the Saints.\n4700
VOC_PRICE_WR8CUT1_2=These streets were ours before those bitches from the Row showed up!  And when they stepped, what did we do?  They fucked up our race, and we just took it.  They fucked up our deliveries, and we just took it.  And now they killed my Uncle, and who knows what the fuck they did to Donnie.  Now, I'm only gonna say this once.  We're not gonna sit here and fuckin' take it.\n22100
VOC_PRICE_WR8CUT1_3=Light 'em up, boys.  We're burning Saint's Row to the ground.\n5000
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_22=We're not going to wait for them to hit us again, we're takin' the fight to the Rollerz.\n3400

VOC_JULIUS_WR8CONVOYDAM_1=We're off to a good start.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CONVOYDAM_2=Keep it up and these bitches ain't gonna have a chance.

VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_5=Could you keep these bitches from shooting us?
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_6=You better pick it up, or we ain't gonna make it.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_7=Are you tryin' to get us killed?
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_8=We can't help the Row if we're dead.
