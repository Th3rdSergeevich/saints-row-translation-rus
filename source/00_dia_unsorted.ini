VOC_TROY_CARCHAT_1=I don't like the idea of Lin going undercover, you roll with people long enough and pretty soon you start thinkin' like 'em...\n5800
VOC_TROY_CARCHAT_2=Alright, here they are...I hope Lin followed up on her end of the deal...\n3700
TROY_STRHOLD_COMPLETE_1=Good job takin' out the Carnales.  With them gone we were able to take Athos Bay, but we can't gain any more ground until you build up our rep.\n8400
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_1=Thank God.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_2=You had me worried there.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_3=Time to disappear.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_4=We made it.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_5=That was close.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_1=Stay away from me!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_2=I told you I wasn't interested!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_3=Get away from me you creep!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_4=We're gonna die!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_5=I don't care if you are my biggest fan, I'm not gonna marry you!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_1=Are you new?  I don't remember you hanging around the Row.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_2=So does Johnny talk about me at all?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_3=None of this would have happened if I didn't sign on with Warren.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_4=Thanks for getting me out of this.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_5=I never should've gotten mixed up with the Vice Kings.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_1=Oh my God!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_2=Are we dead?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_3=Be careful, we're sitting in a bomb!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_4=(screams)
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_5=It didn't go off did it?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_1=Where are you goin'?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_2=Get in here and drive!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_3=We gotta get there before this thing explodes!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_4=Don't leave me here!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_5=Get back in here or I'm calling Johnny!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_1=It's just like my first date with Johnny.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_2=God, are they okay?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_3=I'm sure they're fine, just drive.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_4=You're crazier than Johnny!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_5=This isn't happening.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_1=We gotta hurry!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_2=We're running out of time.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_3=We gotta get there.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_4=Are we gonna make it?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_5=If we don't get to the studio soon, we're dead!
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_1=So uh, you don't talk much do you?
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_2=Hey hey hey, slow down, we don't want to hit anything.
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_3=We're not gonna make it.  Why did I let Johnny talk me into this?
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_4=Right on time.
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_1=God, you haven't changed at all, have you?\n2300
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_10=But the real deal is that once you're in you can't get out.  They rip you off left and right, and they extort you to stay signed.  I've talked to Johnny and he said that you might be willing to help me.\n9700
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_11=Johnny, I really appreciate--\n1800
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_2=It's always the same shit with you.\n1400
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_3=What did you want me to do?  Did you expect me not to take my shot?\n3100
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_4=Oh, fuck you Johnny.\n1000
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_5=My sister was kidnapped!\n1600
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_6=No, he did.\n2200
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_7=Look, if you're gonna help me, help me, but don't you dare try to hold it over me.\n4700
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_8=Fine.\n500
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_9=He's being melodramatic.  See, I'm signed with Kingdom Come Records.\n4000
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT2_1=Hey now, you gotta look good to sound good.\n2900
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT2_2=Would you do that for me?\n2600
VOC_Aisha_VK2Damage_1=For the last time, leave me alone!
VOC_Aisha_VK2Damage_2=This guy's been harassing me for weeks, he's crazy!
VOC_Aisha_VK2Damage_3=Oh God, oh God, oh God!
VOC_Aisha_VK2SeeStalker_1=Oh God, him again?\n1600
VOC_Aisha_VK2StalkerDies_1=I guess I don't need that restraining order anymore.
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_1=Johnny, you said you'd take me out to dinner.\n2800
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_2=At Freckle Bitch's.\n1500
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_3=Someplace good?  Why couldn't you have taken me to Mikano's?\n4500
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_4=You boys talk, I'll be right back.\n2700
VOC_Aisha_VK5CUT1_1=You think it'll work?\n1300
VOC_Aisha_VK5CUT1_2=Please bring Johnny back.  Just don't tell him I was worried.\n4400
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_1=That's a sweet ride Lin.\n2200
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_2=The spoiler looks like Donnie's work.\n1900
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_3=Yeah, I guess it does.\n1200
VOC_AMWR_WR1CUT1_4=Whaddya mean?\n1200
VOC_AMWR2_WRCUT1_1=Who tuned it for ya?\n1300
VOC_AMWR2_WRCUT1_2=No way, that underglow screams Ricky Liu.\n2100
VOC_AMWR2_WRCUT1_3=Dude, she totally wants you.\n3000
VOC_AMWR3_WRCUT1_1=Who tuned it for ya?\n1300
VOC_AMWR3_WRCUT1_2=No way, that underglow screams Ricky Liu.\n2100
VOC_AMWR3_WRCUT1_3=Dude, she totally wants you.\n3000
VOC_ANGELO_LC10ATTACK_1=Don't you ever give up?
VOC_ANGELO_LC10ATTACK_2=I'm not dying like my brother!
VOC_ANGELO_LC10ATTACK_3=This ends here!
VOC_ANGELO_LC10CUT2_1=Luz, where are you?  Well evidently you are talking to me.  Luz, I apologized okay?  Now get your ass to the airport.  What do you mean why, have you seen the house?  We gotta get outta town.  It doesn't matter, just pack some things and let's go.  For God's sake, just leave them.  I don't give a fuck, they're shoes!  Good.  Good, good, good, good, I'll be waiting for you.  Bye-bye.  Get the plane ready, she'll be here soon.\n31400
VOC_ANGELO_LC10CUT2_2=We're taking off.  You and you, let's go.\n2500
VOC_ANGELO_LC10CUT2_3=Fuck her.\n2300
VOC_ANGELO_LC3CUT1_2=Let's get back to Hector.\n1200
VOC_ANGELO_LC3CUT1_3=Cool, I'm buyin'.\n6300
VOC_ANGELO_LC4CUT2_1=Hey, don't you walk away from me, puta!\n2200
VOC_ANGELO_LC4CUT2_2=Woman, you listen to me--\n3200
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_1=Hello.  Hey-hey Victor, I'm in the middle of something -- What?  WHAT!\n9100
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_2=Victor, listen to me very carefully.  I don't give a fuck about the drugs, I don't give a fuck about Orejuela--\n5400
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_3=Who did this to my brother?\n2500
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_4=LUZ!  Okay, okay, you're right.  You deal with the Saints, I'll handle the Colombians.  If Manuel is behind this...(Spanish)\n12700
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_5=(Spanish)\n1000
VOC_ANGELO_LC7CUT2_1=What does it look like I'm doing?\n1200
VOC_ANGELO_LC7CUT2_3=Are you protecting him?!  You want to be with him?\n1200
VOC_ANGELO_LC8CUT2_2=You'll die for what you did to my brother.\n1500
VOC_ANGELO_LC9ATTACK_1=I won't miss this time.
VOC_ANGELO_LC9ATTACK_2=After your dead I'm going to kill that Manuel.
VOC_ANGELO_LC9ATTACK_4=Nobody fucks with my family!
VOC_ANGELO_LC9ATTACK_5=How dare you disrespect my fathers house...
VOC_ANGELO_LC9ATTACK_6=You're gonna die here...
VOC_ANGELO_LC9DAMAGE_3=What the hell are you waiting for, take off!
VOC_ANGELO_LC9DAMAGE_4=This isn't happening...
VOC_ANGELO_LC9DEFEATED_1=This isn't over!
VOC_BFHO_VK1SPOT_1=The guy with the key went to Tee'N'Ay.
VOC_BFStrp_EscortCut_1=Hey baby...\n500
VOC_BM3SS2_FinalCUT1_1=Just say the word.\n1500
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_1=We got a problem Dex.\n1600
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_2=The Los Carnales are--\n1200
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_3=Dex, they're attacking the Row!\n1800
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_4=Angelo and his boys came outta no where, they fucked us up pretty hard, but it finally looked like we had Angelo pinned down...\n8100
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_5=Angelo and Victor did, but there was a lot of LC still out there.\n4400
VOC_BMBNCR_VANCUT_1=Reno wants to see you in the back.\n2000
VOC_BMCOP_LC5CUT2_1=That was a hell of a tip.\n1600
VOC_BMCOP_LC5CUT2_2=It don't matter, he got taken care of anyway.\n2500
VOC_BMCOP_LC5CUT2_3=Monroe's just happy Lopez is dead, as far as he's concerned this case is closed...hell if he found the guy who did this he'd probably send him a fruit basket.\n10000
VOC_Deb_HitCut_1=Don't ask questions, just come with me.\n2000
VOC_Deb_HitCut_2=This...is for you.\n2000
VOC_Deb_HitCut_3=If... you kill him.\n2000
VOC_Deb_HitCut_4=Right now I'm willing to bet you're thinking one of two things.  Either your thinking, "There's no way I can kill someone who's done nothing to me" or you're thinking, "How am I gonna spend all that cash".  Let me tell you something sweetie, the second thought is gonna get you farther in this world.\n16500
VOC_DEX_3SS4_DRIVING_1=We only get one chance at this, so we can't fuck this up.  Once we hit Monroe we better get out of there quick, the last thing we want is to make big scene.  Look, I'm gonna be honest with you dawg, once we hit the chief of police there's no turning back.  Sure, the motherfuckas that got Julius are gonna get a wake up call, but you gotta believe the po-po are gonna be on our ass.  I guess what I'm sayin' man is that if you wanna back out, no one is gonna blame you.  Well, Johnny might, but he's an asshole anyway so I wouldn't stress it.  Anyway, Johnny and I got this worked out so the hit should be smoother than Aisha's pussy.  McManus'll be waiting for us at a building along the procession route.  Take that bad boy and wait to take your shot.  We'll never get a chance like this again so let's not fuck it up.\n39930
VOC_Dex_3SS4Arrive_1=Johnny is set up across the street, he'll be giving us cover if things go bad after the hit.  Now let's get to the roof before mourners roll by.\n7000
VOC_Dex_3SS4Car_1=We only get one chance at this, so we can't fuck this up.  Once we hit Monroe we better get out of there quick, the last thing we want is to make big scene.\n7800
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_1=Have you heard back from Monroe?\n1400
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_2=Looks like we wait.\n1300
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_3=And what would you rather do?\n1700
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_4=Johnny, we're not blowing up City Hall.\n3100
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_5=What if they're keeping Julius there?\n1800
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_6=You're right, there is.  Marshall Winslow was a major public figure, and you can bet your ass that people would ask questions if the chief of police wasn't at his funeral.  I say we hit Monroe during the funeral procession.  That should show whoever he's working with that we're not fucking around.\n14600
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_7=Yeah.\n1200
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_8=Let's fuckin' do it.\n1300
VOC_Dex_3SS4MissionEnd_1=They'll be scooping Monroe up for weeks.\n4000
VOC_Dex_3SS4MissionStart_1=Alright, let's get goin'.  Johnny's going to meet us there.
VOC_Dex_3SS4Sniper_1=Take this.  When the funeral procession comes into view, take out Monroe.  He'll be the one in the cop car.\n6300
VOC_Dex_3SS4Sniper_2=Okay, here comes the procession, just line up with the cop car and... aw shit, there's more than one.  Alright this ain't a problem, it'll just take a little more work to find out what car he's in.\n10100
VOC_Dex_3SS4Sniper_3=Fuck!  Well, they know we're here, no sense in being subtle.
VOC_DEX_LC10AIRPORT_1=Looks like we made it just in time.
VOC_DEX_LC10AK47_1=Hey man, you're a better shot.  You take the AK, I'll take the wheel.  We gotta fuck that plane up good.\n4800
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT1_1=Hey man, we don't got time!\n1600
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT1_2=One of Troy's crew saw Angelo drivin' to the airport.  We gotta stop his ass 'fore he can skip town and rebuild.\n8100
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_1=Johnny's gonna be jealous.\n7000
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_10=Ya know what, I think Julius was right about you.\n4500
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_2=What are you doing here?\n1300
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_3=So what's in here?  Guns?  Money?  Some uncut shit?...  Shoes?\n5500
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_4=Just let it go man, no reason to piss off Manuel.  Let's get goin'.\n4100
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_5=I don't fucking care.\n1500
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_6=See answer "A".\n1500
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_7=Bitch, you're trying my patience.\n1700
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_8=I changed my mind, shoot her.\n6900
VOC_DEX_LC10CUT3_9=Good job man, I'll tell Julius we're done here.  Take Angelo's ride, I'll drive this back to your crib.\n7700
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_1=Not bad man, but we gotta do a lot more damage than that.
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_10=Come on man, don't let up!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_11=Get out of that plane you pussy!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_12=Let's finish the Carnales for good!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_13=It's over mother fucker!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_2=Keep unloadin' on that plane like that, and there's no way they can take off.\n4000
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_3=We're close man, just a little more and the Carnales are gon' be nothin' but a memory.\n5000
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_4=Don't let Angelo get away!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_5=Angelo, you're not going anywhere!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_6=That's right playa, fuck him up!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_7=We can't let that plane take off!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_8=You got no where to hide Angelo!
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDAM_9=Do this bitch like you did his brother.
VOC_DEX_LC10PLANEDIE_1=Holy shit, we did it!
VOC_DEX_LC10START_1=We don't got much time, if Lopez is able to get on that plane we're fucked.\n3800
VOC_DEX_LC10TAKEOFF_1=Hey I don't mean to rush you or nothin', but can you please take that bitch out?\n3400
VOC_DEX_LC10TAKEOFF_2=Fuck, we were so close.
VOC_DEX_LC10TIMELOW_1=Come on man, pick it up.
VOC_DEX_LC10TIMEOUT_1=Fuck! We lost him.
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_1=Thanks, I'll swing by to pick that up.  Just the guy I was lookin' for.  Samson's got the truck all patched up, I'm gonna go--\n6800
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_2=What's goin' on?\n900
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_3=It's not THE Los Carnales, Jesus, what's wrong with you--\n3200
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_4=What happened?\n700
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_6=So they left?\n1000
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_7=Alright, let's split up, the Row's a big place, and we gotta make sure we smoke all those muthafuckas.\n5800
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_1=Shit Troy...\n1300
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_2=If you wanted to know all you had to do was ask.\n3300
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_3=Well, I guess you did, ain't that a bitch.  Now that we have things in the Row under control we can get back to the plan.  I had that truck you jacked fixed up good as new.  Load it up with a crew and drive it right into the Carnales production plant.  When you get inside, hop out and take the place over.\n17600
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_4=There's something to be said about the classics.  Remember what I said.  Take the place over, don't blow it to hell.  The more shit you blow up, the more shit we have to replace once we're runnin' it.\n11900
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_1=I'll take it.\n1100
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_2=No, that's okay.\n800
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_3=Tight job on that lab, dawg.  We found a memo sayin' that Hector is meetin' with the Colombians tonight.  With the amount of firepower that's going to be there, just showing up and rushin' 'em would be suicide.  Take "McManus" here and get to the docks.  Find a nice tall building and wait.  When Hector makes his move with the Colombians, take your shot.\n20000
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_4=Just the same, I'd get the fuck out of there.  Who knows what could happen.\n4200
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_1=So this guy's the mouth piece for the Colombians huh?
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_2=And he's in town.\n1800
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_3=Interesting.\n1500
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_4=Yeah, and so are we.  We kill Orejuela, and the Colombians'll be all up our ass.  Let's figure out what his game is first, then we'll decide what to do.  You know where he is?\n9100
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_5=Cool.  Alright man, let's go buy this drug lord a lap dance.\n4400
VOC_DEX_LC6DAMAGE_1=Quit fuckin' around, I don't wanna be Victors hood ornament.
VOC_DEX_LC6DAMAGE_2=What are you doin' man?
VOC_DEX_LC6DAMAGE_3=Can you not get us killed?
VOC_DEX_LC6DAMAGE_4=I don't think this muthafucka want's to talk things out.
VOC_DEX_LC6PARK_1=Okay, let's sit tight, Manuel should be here soon.
VOC_DEX_LC6SPOT_1=Fuck the Colombian, we gotta get outta here!
VOC_DEX_LC6START_1=Aight, let's go and swing by the strip club and wait to see who shows up.\n4000
VOC_DEX_LC6WIN_1=Nice drivin', you saved our ass.\n2700
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_1=Where's Johnny when you need him?
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_2=It's like ridin' a fuckin' bike.
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_3=I don't know how long we can hold out, Julius!
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_4=Do these bitches stop?
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_5=They're still coming!
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_6=Hey Troy, you okay man?
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_7=I need help here!
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_8=No one fucks up our church!
VOC_DEX_LC7ATTACK_9=How many are there?
VOC_DEX_LC7CUT1_1=Julius, I don't see what the big deal is.\n1900
VOC_DEX_LC7CUT1_2=We didn't even get to meet him Jules.\n2000
VOC_DEX_LC7CUT1_3=Fine.  Julius, you put me in charge of the Los Carnales.  Shit, now you got me sayin' it.\n5900
VOC_DEX_LC7CUT1_4=Yeah.\n900
VOC_DEX_LC7DAMAGE_1=You okay Julius?
VOC_DEX_LC7DAMAGE_2=What you doin'? Get our man's back!
VOC_DEX_LC7DAMAGE_3=Stay cool Julius, we got ya covered.
VOC_DEX_LC7DAMAGE_4=You asleep or somethin'? Start helpin' Julius!
VOC_DEX_LC8CUT1_1=He just got back from a sit-down with Orejuela and they came to an... interesting agreement:  If we can get back all the drugs the cops seized, the Colombians are willing to work with us exclusively.  We'll have a lock on the whole city.\n13100
VOC_DEX_LC8CUT1_2=We're taking out the police station.\n1500
VOC_DEX_LC8CUT1_3=It's Jules', I mean Julius' plan.  He called it, we have to go with it.\n5100
VOC_DEX_LC8CUT1_4=That might lower the body count.\n1400
VOC_DEX_LC8CUT1_5=Aight, let's do it.
VOC_DEX_LC8CUT2_1=I wonder if he means us or Manuel?\n3300
VOC_DEX_LC9ARRIVE_1=Here we go.  Hey, I'd really appreciate it if you make sure I don't get dead.\n5500
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_1=Suddenly I'm less excited to be here.
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_10=Angelo doesn't have a chance.
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_2=Angelo can't hide forever.
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_3=Hey, I ain't doin' too bad here, am I?
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_4=Stay focused Dex.
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_5=You come to our house, we come to yours!
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_6=You shoulda stayed outta the Row!
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_7=Where are you Angelo?
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_8=Hey, this isn't so hard.
VOC_DEX_LC9ATTACK_9=The Saints aren't scared of the Carnales!
VOC_DEX_LC9CAR_1=Let's just make sure we get there in one piece.  We're gonna have enough problems with Angelo's boys, we don't need any other suprises.\n6800
VOC_DEX_LC9CARDAMAGE_1=This hooptie ain't gonna make it if we take any more hits like that.
VOC_DEX_LC9CARDAMAGE_2=Get yo hand off your dick and on the trigger, we gotta stop Angelo!
VOC_DEX_LC9CARDAMAGE_3=How 'bout you shoot those bitches before they blow our asses up?
VOC_DEX_LC9CARDAMAGE_4=You asleep or somethin'?
VOC_DEX_LC9CARDAMAGE_5=Hey man, can you stop these mother fuckers from shootin' us?
VOC_DEX_LC9CARDAMAGE_6=If this ride dies on us we're not gonna catch Angelo!
VOC_DEX_LC9CHAT_1=Just between you and me man, I don't trust Manuel.  If he's willing to sell out Angelo so quickly, what's to stop him from selling us out?\n8000
VOC_DEX_LC9CHAT_2=I really hate to sound like Johnny, but the best plan I got right now is just to go in there and take Angelo out.\n5900
VOC_DEX_LC9CHAT_3=I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about taking the fight to Angelo, but he's come knockin' on our door twice, and I think it's time to return the favor.\n8000
VOC_DEX_LC9CHAT_4=Alright, the mansion's coming up.  I got your back, just make sure I don't get killed, okay?\n4100
VOC_DEX_LC9CUT1_1=Shit!\n1000
VOC_DEX_LC9CUT1_2=Don't just stand there, get in, muthafucka!\n3700
VOC_DEX_LC9CUT3_1=You got to be fuckin' kidding me!\n2000
VOC_DEX_LC9CUT3_3=Shit!\n1000
VOC_DEX_LC9CUT3_4=Don't worry 'bout it, he ain't got to many places he can go.  We'll find him.\n4500
VOC_DEX_LC9DAMAGE_1=That mothafucka shot me!
VOC_DEX_LC9DAMAGE_2=Hey I'm not as hard as Johnny, how 'bout you give me a hand?
VOC_DEX_LC9DAMAGE_3=Fuck!
VOC_DEX_LC9DAMAGE_4=Where the hell are you?  These bitches are shootin' me!
VOC_DEX_LC9ENTER_1=I know this isn't my style, but after that shit at the church, I wanna make sure Angelo gets what's comin' to him.\n5300
VOC_DEX_LC9PHONE_1=Hey man, I checked out that address Manuel gave us.  It's legit.  Pick me up at the church; I want to be there when we take that bastard out.\n9000
VOC_DEX_LC9RUNOVER_10=You better cool that shit down, otherwise we're gonna get arrested before we get to Angelo.
VOC_DEX_LC9RUNOVER_6=You are one sick mother fucker, you know that?
VOC_DEX_LC9RUNOVER_7=Can you dial that shit down, I don't wanna deal with the cops and the Carnales.
VOC_DEX_LC9RUNOVER_8=Shit man, they owe you money or somethin'?
VOC_DEX_LC9RUNOVER_9=I know we're in a hurry, but can you be a little more careful?
VOC_DEX_LC9TIMEOUT_1=What are we waiting for?

DEX_LC10_CARDAMAGE_2=Can you keep my car from being totalled?
DEX_LC10_CARDAMAGE_3=They're tearin' my car up...
DEX_LC10_CARDAMAGE_4=Aren't you supposed to stop my car from getting fucked up?
DEX_LC10_CARDAMAGE_5=I swear to god, every time I fix her up, some asshole puts a bullet in my car...
DEX_LC10_CARDAMAGE_6=I'd appreciate it if you could keep my ride from bein' trashed...
DEX_LC10_CARDAMAGE_7=Stop these assholes from shootin' up my whip!
DEX_LC10_CARDAMAGE_8=Julius better cover these damages...(THIS)
DEX_LC10_SEERPG_1=Where the fuck did they get rocket launchers?
DEX_LC10_SEERPG_2=Take out those chumps with the RPGS!
DEX_LC10_SEERPG_3=We gotta drop those bitches with the rocket launchers!
DEX_LC10_SEERPG_4=Kill those muthafuckas before they blow us up!

VOC_Dex_VK1CUT1_1=What's up?\n800
VOC_Dex_VK1CUT1_2=Shit man, that's the sixth girl this month.  We know who's doing this?\n4400
VOC_DEX_VK1CUT1_3=No way man, kidnapping ain't King's style.\n2800
VOC_Dex_VK5CUT1_1=The shit Johnny said about Warren and Tanya really got to Tony.  Now, the only time she's allowed out of his sight is when she's checking on the rebuilding of the recording studio.\n7500
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_1=Johnny, your idea of a plan is taking the biggest hammer you can find and smashing whatever's in your way.\n5700
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_2=Yeah, a shitty one, as your whack ass robo-leg clearly proves.\n3600
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_3=Next time you try that cowboy shit, you might not walk away at all.\n3700
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_4=Look, I worked out a plan that will hurt the Kings, and put minimum risk on you.\n3900
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_5=None.\n700
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_6=Hear me out, alright?  King's obviously got somethin' goin' on with the police, I'll figure that shit out.  In the meantime I want you two to go out and cause some havoc.  If we can turn the public's eye to the Kings then the police won't have a choice but to come down on them.\n14200
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_7=Put these on.\n1100
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_8=Just put the damn shirt on.\n1800
VOC_Dex_VK6bCUT1_1=Okay, it looks like the cops have been getting in on some of King's protection rackets; that's why they've been goin' so easy on the VKs.  We gotta go public with this shit.  Now if we--\n9400
VOC_Dex_VK6bCUT1_2=Johnny, you can't be serious.\n1500
VOC_Dex_VK6bCUT1_3=Where did you get those?\n1700
VOC_Dex_VK6bCUT1_4=This isn't gonna end well.\n1500
VOC_DONNIE_WR3CUT2_1=We gotta get out of here!\n2000
VOC_DONNIE_WR3CUT2_2=Look, I--\n1000
VOC_DONNIE_WR3CUT2_3=Who are you?\n1000
VOC_DONNIE_WR3SPOT_1=Oh fuck me!
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_1=Sup Price?\n1600
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_2=I scared the shit outta me.\n2100
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_3=Aw fuck, I forgot, this is--\n1800
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_4=She totally saved my ass Mr. Sharp, she's a helluva driver.\n3700
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_5=Yeah, then it was hilarious.\n2900
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_6=So we're finally hitting that convoy huh?\n2600
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_7=Sure you--\n700
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT1_8=Oh... Riiight.  Just sit tight, Price should be back soon.\n4400
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_1=Ya know what I hate?  Underglow.  That shit is tacky as hell.\n5900
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_2=The same guys who fucked up my shop, I think they're the Fifth Street Alter Boys or somethin'.\n3600
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_3=What she said.\n900
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_4=If you need me to focus, I'd pass that shit back.  (coughs)\n4600
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_5=Alright alright.  You got some time before the buyers need those parts right?\n4200
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_6=Oh, they're a bunch of guys overseas that Mr. Sharp kn--\n2600
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_7=Sorry.\n900
VOC_DONNIE_WR4CUT2_8=Give me some time.  I bet Lin and I can whip somethin' up.\n3100
VOC_DONNIE_WR5CUT1_1=Lin and I got this shit down.\n2400
VOC_DONNIE_WR5CUT1_2=Alright kids, check this shit out.  So we lost the parts the buyers wanted, and there's no way another shipment like that is going to roll through here again any time soon.  Lin and I did the math, and there are a couple key cars that we can strip down to get the parts we need.\n15100
VOC_DONNIE_WR5CUT1_3=Lin, (stutters) don't worry 'bout--\n1600
VOC_DONNIE_WR7CUT_1=What are you doing driving Lin's ride, Mr. Sharp?\n2900
VOC_DONNIE_WR7CUT_2=Lin?\n1100
VOC_DONNIE_WR7CUT_3=LIN!\n2000
VOC_DONNIE_WR7CUT_4=Count to ten?  You just shot my girl!\n3200
VOC_DONNIE_WR7CUT_5=Why did... why did you...\n2900
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_1=Did you handle it?\n1000
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_2=Where the fuck is Julius?\n2500
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_3=Why?  So we can let this jag-off jerk us around?  Fuck that.\n3500
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_4=You know exactly what I'd like to do.\n3000
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_5=I'm just sayin, it would solve a lot of problems.\n3400
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_6=Alright, but there's gotta be a better plan than "let's be Monroe's bitches".\n4000
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_7=You're sayin' we should assassinate the chief of police while he's at the funeral of the guy we just smashed.\n6500
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_8=Don't tease me Dex.\n1300
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_1=Take a seat, man.\n4300
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_2=So you're Julius' new boy huh? You don't look like much.  Then again, I don't look like I have an eight inch cock, so I guess we're both full of surprises.\n8800
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_3=The Vice Kings are named after one guy: Benjamin King.  That shit don't happen unless you're a professional or a bad ass, and in King's case, he's both.\n10800
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_4=Hold up, I gotta take this.  Aisha, what a pleasant fucking surprise.  Whoa, slow down.  Okay that's not slower, that's louder.  Shit, where's she headed?   Don't worry, I got this.\n17700
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_5=Some mother fucker's grabbed Aisha's sister right off the street.\n2700
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_6=Yeah, the Vice Kings.\n1800
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_7=Maybe that slut Tanya is goin' behind King's back, don't know, don't fuckin' care.  Aisha said they were drivin' a yellow sedan.  Tail those bitches back to wherever they go and get those girls back.\n9900
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_10=Relax man; I'd like you to meet Saint's Row's claim to fame.  This... is Aisha.  And tonight we're gonna kill her.\n7800
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_11=And it's no secret that the label is owned by the Vice Kings.\n2600
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_12=Check it out: Eesh has a recording session in a few minutes.  That's when we make her disappear and give the Vice Kings a nice "fuck you" while we're at it.  I want you to take Aisha to her session, but on the way stop at the chop shop to have your ride loaded up with some C4.  Park the car at the studio and get the hell outta there.  Eesh, make sure someone sees you before you jump out.\n20500
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_13=Whatever, I was gonna blow that place up anyway.\n2000
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_2=Not all of us have a couple million dollars to make changes.\n2600
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_3=Oh, here we go again.\n1100
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_4=No, I expected you to remember where you came from.\n2900
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_5=Fuck me?  Fuck you!  You're the one who ran off to be famous.  The only time you remember who we are is when you want something.\n6900
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_6=And I brought her back didn't I?\n1200
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_7=Bullshit, I told him to do it.  No offense.\n4300
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_8=Fine.\n900
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_9=Fine.\n900
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_1=Look, I know you're supposed to be dead and all, but do you have to look this pissed?\n4300
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_2=And here we are.\n1700
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_3=Where else would we go?\n1200
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_4=Aisha, it's not like... hey what's up?\n3300
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_5=Perfect timing.\n1000
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_6=Whatever, she don't appreciate fine dining.  Now I've been talkin' to Eesh's sister.  Turns out Tanya's been fuckin' people in every sense of the word.  Not only is she blowin' King's bodyguard Big Tony, but she's fuckin' Warren Williams, their numbers guy, whenever Tony ain't lookin'.  Between Tony and Warren the only person she isn't leading around by their cock is King.  So I'm thinkin' we put the hurt on Tanya, we're fuckin' up the Vice Kings.  She's got an operation in Prawn Court, that's where we'll start.  Roll in there and put the murder on anyone you see, customers included.  Who wants to die for a blowjob right?  When you go for Tanya, be careful, she's probably got some muscle in there.\n39300
VOC_Gat_VK3aPhone1_1=So much for Tanya's hired help.  Now get your ass over to the whorehouse and drop that chickenhead.\n5700
VOC_Gat_VK4aArrive_1=There's our boys.  Let's drop some Vice Queens.
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_1=Come on muthafuckas, you can do better than that!
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_10=We're gonna take this place, just like we took the ho house!
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_11=The Saints are through bein' pushed around!
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_12=I'm sending all you fuckers home in a box!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_2=Don't stop now, we got more killin' to do.
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_3=Don't let that bitch get away!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_4=Fuck yeah!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_5=Get up so I can shoot you again!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_6=This shit is too easy.
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_7=Ya hear that Tanya?  I'm gettin' closer.
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_8=Step on up boys and girls, everyone gets a turn.
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_9=When are you bitches gonna get the message, stay out of Stillwater!
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_1=Let's hurry up, we don't want to miss the fun.
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_2=I hope you can keep up with me in there.
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_3=Hey, I can't kill anyone if I'm dead!
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_4=This is a car, not some bitch who forgot the safe word.
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_5=Did you see that fucker bounce?
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_6=Let's save some of that for the station, k?
VOC_GAT_VK4ACOLLIDE_1=Slow down man, we'll get that bitch soon enough..
VOC_GAT_VK4ACOLLIDE_2=Would you mind not runnin into me?
VOC_GAT_VK4ACOLLIDE_3=Watch it, I'm jumpy enough as it is.
VOC_GAT_VK4ACOLLIDE_4=What's your problem man?
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT1_1=Good thing you're here, I was about to leave without ya.  I don't think I'm feelin' the bat today.  This is always the hardest part for me... ya know, balancing stopping power with personal enjoyment.  Oooo, yeah, I'm feelin' this.  It ain't gonna be easy clearin' all those VKs outta the station, so I told my crew to meet us there.  Let's ride.\n25500
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_10=So do you.\n1000
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_11=GO NOW!\n1000
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_2=Well of course you would, you bein' her bitch.\n2000
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_3=Hey, no reason to be hostile.\n1500
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_4=Just some rubbers, I was hopin' I could get some of Williams' sloppy seconds.\n5700
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_5=Guess I hit a nerve.\n1200
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_6=Well, that explains how your bitch lost Prawn Court.\n2600
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_7=Yeah Tanya, shut the fuck up.\n1400
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_8=I got shitty hearing.\n1000
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_1=Oh, I like it when they play hard to get.
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_2=I'm fine, keep moving.
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_3=You think a couple bullets are gonna stop me?!
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_4=Mother fucker!
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_5=Hey man, are you gonna cover me or what?
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_6=A little help here would be nice!
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_1=Oh, I'm gonna take my time with you.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_2=Bitch, your day is about to get a whole lot worse.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_3=You couldn't take me out on your best day.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_4=This is what Tanya's got for protection?  That girl is fucked.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_1=A swing like that, you wouldn't last five minutes in the Row.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_2=Motherfucker just hit me.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_3=See, that's just gonna piss me off.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_4=Becareful, somebody's gonna get hurt...
VOC_GAT_VK4AFFIREATTK_1=Fuck it, I'll finish this myself.
VOC_GAT_VK4AFFIREATTK_2=You think you can take me on?
VOC_GAT_VK4AFFIREWARN_1=You don't cut that shit out, I'll put you down myself.
VOC_GAT_VK4AFFIREWARN_2=I'm running out of patience.
VOC_GAT_VK4AFLEE_1=Where ya think you're going?
VOC_GAT_VK4AFLEE_2=Come on, who am I fighting, a Vice King or a ho?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_1=Man, I love your work.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_2=Not too shabby.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_3=Ya know, we should really do this more often.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_4=You don't fuck around, do ya?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_1=It's been too long.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_2=I could do this all night.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_3=Tanya, we're getting closer...
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_4=Anyone else think they're hard?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_5=Who's next?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRENADE_1=Shit!
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRENADE_2=Incoming!
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRENADE_3=Clear out!
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRENADE_4=Fuck us!
VOC_GAT_VK4AKNOCKDOWN_1=What, that's it?
VOC_GAT_VK4AKNOCKDOWN_2=Bitch, you just bled on my shoes.
VOC_GAT_VK4ARELOAD_1=Buddy, when this thing's loaded, you're dead.
VOC_GAT_VK4ARELOAD_2=I ain't runnin' out anytime soon.
VOC_GAT_VK4ARELOAD_3=You're luck's about to run out...
VOC_GAT_VK4ARELOAD_4=You can't hold out forever...
VOC_GAT_VK4ATIMEOUT_1=We better get movin' or Tanya's gonna get away again.
VOC_GAT_VK4ATIMEOUT_2=I didn't bring this gun along for show, let's get moving.
VOC_Gat_VK5Combat_1=Don't worry about me, take that fucker out!
VOC_Gat_VK5Combat_2=You and I are havin' a talk after this.
VOC_Gat_VK5Combat_3=I'm gettin' a little tired of bein' shot here! 
VOC_Gat_VK5Combat_4=Well, this day keeps gettin' better and better.
VOC_Gat_VK5Combat_5=Don't you die on me you pussy!
VOC_Gat_VK5Combat_6=Tony, that's just gonna piss him off.
VOC_Gat_VK5CUT4_1=Hey, not to be pushy or nothin', but how 'bout you get me out of this fucking chair?!\n6000
VOC_Gat_VK5CUT4_2=Bout fuckin' time you got here.\n2000
VOC_Gat_VK5CUT4_3=Where's Green?\n2000
VOC_Gat_VK5CUT4_4=That's much better.  I heard Green say that he's got some heavy shit in the back.  I'll have some of our boys roll on over and bring the hardware back to the crib.\n9500
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_1=Wooo!
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_10=You wanna fuck with us?
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_2=Don't fuck with the Sa-- Vice Kings, don't fuck with the Vice Kings! 
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_3=The Vice Kings own this town!
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_4=You see this yellow!  That means I'm a Vice King!
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_5=Vice Kings do what we want, when we want!
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_6=You never shoulda messed with the Saints!  Or the Vice Kings, 'cause that's what we are!
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_7=Benjamin King owns this town!
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_8=The Vice Kings are gonna tear this place up!
VOC_GAT_VK6AATTACK_9=You think you can step to the 3rd Street Vice Kings!
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_1=Dex, don't worry, I have a plan.\n1900
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_2=That sounds like a plan to me.\n1400
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_3=Oh, fuck you.\n1200
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_4=No, seriously, fuck you.\n3600
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_5=How much murderin' do I get to do.\n1600
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_6=Your plan blows.\n1200
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_7=Okay, so we go and do some damage.  How do the VKs get blamed?\n4100
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_8=I'm yellow enough as it is, Dex.\n1700
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_9=Fine.  Get dressed.  We got a little peace to disturb.\n4200
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_1=Remind me to thank Dex for this great plan...
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_10=How bout we drop these guys before they kill us both!
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_2=How 'bout you keep me from getting shot!
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_3=Help me out, I don't wanna die in these colors!
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_4=This is not my day...
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_5=You gonna keep these fuckers off me or what?
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_6=Goddamn it, what are you doin' over there?
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_7=Bein' shot is getting a little old, man.
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_8=Stop fucking around and kill these bitches!
VOC_GAT_VK6ADAMAGE_9=We gotta pick it up, I ain't dying here!
VOC_GAT_VK6AHITOBJECT_1=You did that to make the Vice Kings look bad, right?
VOC_GAT_VK6AHITOBJECT_2=You okay to drive man?
VOC_GAT_VK6AHITOBJECT_3=Shit man, watch where you're going...
VOC_GAT_VK6AHITOBJECT_4=Could you not get us killed please?
VOC_GAT_VK6AHITOBJECT_5=Fuck it, we can steal another one.
VOC_GAT_VK6ALOSTVAN_1=Hey, slow down, we're losing the news vans.
VOC_GAT_VK6ALOSTVAN_2=Shit, we gotta go back for that news van.
VOC_GAT_VK6ALOSTVAN_3=Yo be more careful, we don't wanna lose the van.
VOC_GAT_VK6ALOSTVAN_4=Hold up, we gotta make sure we're on camera.
VOC_GAT_VK6ALOSTVAN_5=Where the hell did the news van go?
VOC_GAT_VK6ANEWLOC_1=Let's get started.  The first thing we're gonna do is torch a couple stores.\n4400
VOC_GAT_VK6ANEWLOC_2=Whaddya say we head downtown and show 'em what we think of modern art?\n4100
VOC_GAT_VK6ANEWLOC_3=I'm getting real sick of hearin' Hughes run his mouth.  I think it's time to thank him for his gift to Stilwater.\n6300
VOC_Gat_VK6aPhone1_1=Let's start out light.  There's a bunch of newsstands downtown, go and tear those bastards apart.
VOC_Gat_VK6aPhone2_1=Not bad, time to step things up.  Kick it to the shopping center and firebomb every mothafuckin' store they got.
VOC_Gat_VK6aPhone3_1=Alright, one more stop and you can come home.  There's a new exibit outside the museum.  How 'bout you roll over there and show 'em how much you appreciate modern art.
VOC_GAT_VK6ARUNOVER_1=Ooo
VOC_GAT_VK6ARUNOVER_2=Oh, that was nice.
VOC_GAT_VK6ARUNOVER_3=Yeah, I think they'll be feeling that in the morning.
VOC_GAT_VK6ARUNOVER_4=We gotta go out more often man.
VOC_GAT_VK6ARUNOVER_5=Very nice...
VOC_GAT_VK6ASTART_1=Alright, if the Vice Kings are gonna take the fall we gotta make sure whatever we do is caught on tape.\n6200
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_1=Okay, we're comin' up on one of the meetings.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_10=Time to take 'em off the payroll...
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_11=Let's do this.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_12=Hope you're a good shot with that thing.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_13=There's some more up ahead.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_14=Time to lighten King's payroll.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_15=Alright, here they come, you know what to do.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_16=Let's give our regards to Stilwater's finest.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_17=You ready to send a message to Monroe and King?
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_18=Get ready, we're comin' up on a meet...
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_19=Another payoff is goin' down up ahead.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_2=You sure you know how to handle that thing?
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_20=Whaddya say we crash their little meeting?
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_3=Get that bad boy ready, there's a meet up ahead.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_4=Time to say hello to Stilwater's finest.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_5=Let's send those fuckers a message.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_6=I love seein' the looks on their faces.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_7=This day keeps getting' better and better.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_8=Let's take care of these guys next.
VOC_GAT_VK6BBREAKUP_9=There they are!
VOC_Gat_VK6bCar_1=Hey, next time, I call dibs on the RPG.
VOC_Gat_VK6bCar_2=One more should do it.
VOC_Gat_VK6bCar_3=Woooohooooo!
VOC_Gat_VK6bCar_4=Man, we should do this every week.
VOC_Gat_VK6bCar_5=Early retirement baby!
VOC_Gat_VK6bCar_6=That was fuckin' sweet!
VOC_Gat_VK6bCar_7=Nice shot, man.
VOC_Gat_VK6bCUT1_1=Don't worry Dex, I have something more subtle in mind.\n4500
VOC_Gat_VK6bCUT1_2=Fuck yeah, I am.\n1400
VOC_Gat_VK6bCUT1_3=Anthony's condo.  He had a big mouth.\n2800
VOC_Gat_VK6bCUT1_4=Don't listen to the old woman.  I'll drive to where the cops are picking up protection money, you make 'em cease and desist with one of Tony's noisemakers.  If we make sure the only cops we hit are the one's working for King, people gonna start askin' questions, and the cops are gonna have no choice but come down on the VKs to save face.  Let's do this.\n17900
VOC_Gat_VK6bCUT2_1=I think the Kings are through with the Policeman's Balls.\n3200
VOC_Gat_VK6bCUT2_2=Now all we got left to do is give Warren a nice final "fuck you", and I'd say this has been a helluva day.\n7000
VOC_GAT_VK6BGRATPC_1=Fuck yeah!
VOC_GAT_VK6BGRATPC_2=Now we're havin' fun...
VOC_GAT_VK6BGRATPC_3=You're a natural!
VOC_GAT_VK6BGRATPC_4=You get to have all the fun...
VOC_GAT_VK6BGRATPC_5=Nice!
VOC_GAT_VK6BHITOBJECT_1=Where'd that come from?
VOC_GAT_VK6BHITOBJECT_2=Damn it!
VOC_GAT_VK6BHITOBJECT_3=I probably should have that looked at.
VOC_GAT_VK6BHITOBJECT_4=Look, uh, let's not tell anyone about this.
VOC_GAT_VK6BHITOBJECT_5=Time to visit Mike and Dan again.
VOC_GAT_VK6BMONOLOGUE_1=So the other day Aisha was giving me shit because I don't do anything nice for her.  Can you believe that?  I mean I've paid for her everytime we go out, so I'm like "The hell you talkin' about, I picked up the check at the firing range" and then she goes on and on about dinner this, and flowers that.  It's fuckin' bullshit, right?  (pause)  Thanks for your advice man, you're a big help.\n21500
VOC_GAT_VK6BRUNOVER_1=Shit, I better wash that before I pick up Aisha tonight.
VOC_GAT_VK6BRUNOVER_2=Fuck it, they're probably fine.
VOC_GAT_VK6BRUNOVER_3=Right of way, my ass...
VOC_GAT_VK6BRUNOVER_4=Time to change the liscence plate again.
VOC_GAT_VK6BRUNOVER_5=Did you see them walk in front of me?
VOC_Gat_VK8CUT1_1=So what's the plan?\n1100
VOC_Gat_VK9Attack_1=You're the best Tanya's got?  Well, I'm dissapointed.
VOC_Gat_VK9Attack_2=I'm getting tired of droppin' all your hos, Tanya!
VOC_Gat_VK9Attack_3=Don't worry, all you muthafucka's get a turn!
VOC_Gat_VK9Attack_4=The coroner's gonna be workin' overtime on your ass!
VOC_Gat_VK9Attack_5=Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_6=I'm ending this here!
VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_7=King, this the best your crew's got?
VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_8=Oh I'm gonna enjoy this...
VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_9=You think you can keep up King?
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_1=King, the only person in this car I'm worried about is you.
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_2=That's why I'm worried.
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_3=I like to be positive.
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_4=What then?
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_5=My kind of plan.
VOC_GAT_VK9COLLIDE_1=Hey, watch the knee.
VOC_GAT_VK9COLLIDE_2=Becareful, this thing's loaded.
VOC_GAT_VK9COLLIDE_3=The fuck you goin'?
VOC_GAT_VK9COLLIDE_4=You see King running around like an asshole?
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_1=I've been chattin' with King, and it looks like Tanya's takeover didn't sit well with everybody.  The Vice Kings are fighting amongst themselves; now's the time to take 'em out for good.  King said he was gonna come along, I hope he hasn't gone soft.\n12700
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_2=All I'm sayin' is that since you got here you've been nothin' but talk.\n3400
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_3=That's just fuckin' great.\n1500
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_4=I don't want you bitchin' out when you see your crew.\n2100
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_5=You heard the cocky sonofabitch, let's roll.\n3600
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT2_1=Where now?\n800
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT2_2=I'm gonna skull fuck that bitch.\n2000
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT2_3=Wha?\n4000
VOC_Gat_VK9Damage_1=Where's my cover?
VOC_Gat_VK9Damage_2=King, you gonna do somethin', or just let me get shot?!
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_1=You really didn't want to do that.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_2=Hey, don't fuck up my shirt, I got a date tonight.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_3=Alright asshole, you wanna play rough?
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_4=A shot like that, no wonder we're kickin' your ass.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_1=You got the balls to hit me you sonofabitch?
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_2=You're gonna have to do better than that.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_3=That was cute.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_4=Don't really think that'll stop me, do you?
VOC_GAT_VK9FFIREATTK_1=Fuck this...
VOC_GAT_VK9FFIREATTK_2=You think you can turn your back on us now!
VOC_GAT_VK9FFIREWARN_1=The hell are you doin'?
VOC_GAT_VK9FFIREWARN_2=What, you on Tanya's payroll?
VOC_GAT_VK9FLEE_1=You're not gonna make it out of here!
VOC_GAT_VK9FLEE_2=A bullet in the back is just as good as a bullet in the front.
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_1=You see that King, my boy knows how to get it done!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_2=Keep it up man!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_3=Tanya doesn't have a chance.
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_4=You've come a long way, haven't you?
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_1=I'm just getting started.
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_2=Who else wants to play?
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_3=None of you mothafuckas can stop us!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_4=I'm comin' Tanya!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_5=Now that's how ya get it done.
VOC_GAT_VK9GRENADE_1=Look out!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRENADE_2=Take cover!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRENADE_3=Get behind something!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRENADE_4=You didn't say they had grenades, King!
VOC_GAT_VK9KNOCKDOWN_1=I'll try to make it quick...
VOC_GAT_VK9KNOCKDOWN_2=Bitch, you never had a chance.
VOC_GAT_VK9POWERCUT_1=Yeah, well, it ain't gonna do 'em much good... people bleed just as well in the dark...
VOC_GAT_VK9RELOAD_1=King, cover me!
VOC_GAT_VK9RELOAD_2=I ain't gonna miss again...
VOC_GAT_VK9RELOAD_3=This isn't over.
VOC_GAT_VK9RELOAD_4=I got more where that came from.
VOC_GAT_VK9START_1=How are we gonna get that?\n1200
VOC_GAT_VK9START_2=Who is this guy?\n1000
VOC_GAT_VK9START_3=I hate him already.\n1000
VOC_GAT_VK9TIMEOUT_1=We gonna kill Tanya or what?
VOC_GAT_VK9TIMEOUT_2=I can't believe I ditched Eesh for this...
VOC_Gat_VKxPhone1_1=I don't know if it's quota time or what, but the cops are leaning hard on us.  Shit's too hot right now, I want you to get off the street... hold on.  What?  You're kiddin' me.  Those fucking cocksuckers!  Change of plans, it looks like the Kings are trying to get back Tanya's old digs as we speak.  Get your ass over there and help our boys.  You're the only backup they're gettin'.\n20500
VOC_Gat_VKxPhone1_2=I hope you're not cashed, we got more work to do.  Troy just got a tip that Tanya's setting up shop in the old Sunnyvale police station.  I talked to Julius, and he gave me the okay to go in with a crew.  I'm headin' back to the church to get strapped.  Come over when you're ready, but don't wait too long, we got some murderin' to do.\n16200
VOC_Green_VK3bCUT1_1=Grip is short, Mr. King.\n1700
VOC_Green_VK3bCUT1_2=It's not her fault Mr. King, the Saints have been fuckin' with her.\n2700
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_1=If I were you, I'd listen to the lady.\n2600
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_2=Watch your fuckin' mouth.\n1600
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_3=Do yourself a favor, stay down and shut the fuck up.  You 3rd Street mothafuckas think you so smart.  Well check this out, we ain't impressed. Hell, the only reason you got as far as you did was 'cause King let you.  We led you right to where we wanted you, and now the police are gonna finish your ass for good, just the way we planned.\n16700
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_4=Don't worry baby, I got this.\n1800
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_5=I thought I told you to be quiet.\n1700
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_6=Now you got a shitty leg.\n2000
VOC_Green_VK4bCUT1_2=I'll see you soon boss.\n2800
VOC_Green_VK5Attack_3=You think you can fuck with my girl?!
VOC_Green_VK5Attack_4=You never shoulda messed with us, son!
VOC_Green_VK5Damage_1=Haha, it's gonna take more than that to drop this nigga!
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_1=Manuel, you worry too much, everything is under control.\n3700
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_2=Like what?\n600
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_3=One of our couriers thought he could cut the shit out of his deliveries.  It looked like we were missing a lot of product, it really was just this pendejo.   Angelo took care of him.\n11300
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_4=Found.\n900
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_5=A bunch of mulas, a nuisance, nothing more.\n2800
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_6=I am not my father.\n1300
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_7=ENOUGH!\n1000
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_8=(Spanish)\n5000
VOC_Helmers_PimpCUT_1=What the hell is wrong with you!\n1500
VOC_Helmers_PimpCUT_2=Wait!  Wait. Sorry man, you're not one of my kids.  I've just been on edge ever since they left.  I took care of those girls since they started growin' titties and how do they pay me back?  By running off with some lowlife in a hat and cane.  Could ya bring them back to daddy, I'd be mighty thankful.\n18750
VOC_HF3SS_LC4CUT1_2=3rd Street!\n800
VOC_HMCNST_VK5CUT2_1=Hello Miss Winters.\n1500
VOC_HMCNST_VK5CUT2_2=He's in the back.\n1000
VOC_HUGHES_RADIO1_2=Marshal may have been my competitor on the campaign trail, but away from the cameras he and I were close friends.  Like myself, Marshal had an unbridled love for this town, and would have given anything to make the life of its citizens better.  Sadly, a street gang named the Third Street Saints didn't share his world view.  In a violent instant the light he wished to shine on every man, woman, and child of Stilwater was snuffed out.  Not by natural causes, not by fate, but by the very people he dedicated his life to help.  Friends, when I first heard of Marshal's passing, like you, I was filled with sorrow.  But as I thought on this tragic circumstance my sorrow turned to outrage.  This wasn't just a murder, no.  This was an act of urban terrorism... a vile and malicious act that served no purpose other than to bring misery and fear to all who live here.  Well I for one am not afraid.  Our enemy has a name and a face, and rest assured they'll learn why justice wields a sword.  Thank you.
VOC_Jack_EscortCUT_1=Hey kid, how'd you like to make some quick cash.\n2500
VOC_Jack_EscortCUT_2=Evidently you aren't familiar with the no touching rule...\n3000
VOC_Jack_EscortCUT_3=You want the money, you do me a favor.  I got a couple of high-profile regulars who want a little more than a lap dance.  Now, normally they could go off to the VIP room, bust a nut and be on their way.  But these guys have special tastes they'd like to keep, uh, private.  Being caught with a hooker is bad enough.  Being caught with a fat hooker is even worse.  I got a girl waiting in a car out back, all you got to do is pick up the John and give the two of them some privacy.  Just make sure no one sees what's going on, alright?\n28000
VOC_Jen_ChopCut_1=Don't mind him, he's just in a bad mood, ain't that right baby?\n4000
VOC_Julius_FinalCUT1_1=We did it, playa. 3rd Street owns this town.   Now, that's not to say that shit didn't cost, and I ain't talkin' about what happened to Johnny's leg or losing Lin. Those two were soldiers, they knew the risk. Hell, Johnny gets off on it.  But we crushed a lot of families playa, and someday they're gonna holla at us. But believe me when I tell you, we did the right thing.  With the Rollerz wiped out, Benjamin gone, and the Colombians in our pocket,  there ain't gonna be a need for a gang war ever again. And in the end, that's gonna save a lot more lives than we took.  So relax, playa, you've earned yourself a break.  You've impressed the hell out of me son, and I've told the crew you're gonna be my right hand-  hold up, some berry just turned on his flashers.  Yeah, playa, I think I'm gonna have to call you back. This may take a while. \n50000
VOC_JULIUS_LC7ATTACK_1=No one fucks with the Saints!
VOC_JULIUS_LC7ATTACK_2=None of these bitches are walkin' out, you hear me?!
VOC_JULIUS_LC7ATTACK_3=You muthafuckas shoulda stayed home!
VOC_JULIUS_LC7ATTACK_4=You neva shoulda came here!
VOC_JULIUS_LC7CUT1_1=The deal is that you went to talk to the Colombians without me.\n2900
VOC_JULIUS_LC7CUT1_2=And don't call me Jules, you haven't earned it.\n2000
VOC_JULIUS_LC7CUT1_3=Dex, do your job, but don't think you're bigger than you are.   When it comes to the Colombians, you call me, understand?\n8100
VOC_JULIUS_LC7CUT1_4=Alright, now that that's settled--\n4100
VOC_JULIUS_LC7DAMAGE_1=Where my boys at?
VOC_JULIUS_LC7DAMAGE_2=Don't worry 'bout me, I'm fine.
VOC_JULIUS_LC7DAMAGE_3=It's gonna take a lot more than that to stop me...
VOC_JULIUS_LC7DAMAGE_4=I ain't goin' out here.
VOC_JULIUS_LC7START_1=Heads up playa, I don't think these bitches stopped by for confession.
VOC_JULIUS_LC7VICTOR_1=You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me, what's this muthafucka made of?
VOC_JULIUS_LC7WAVE1_1=They're comin' from the side entrance!
VOC_JULIUS_LC7WAVE2_1=Victor and his crew are stormin' the church!
VOC_JULIUS_LC7WIN_1=Well, that coulda went worse...
VOC_JULIUS_LC8CUT2_1=I'm glad we could work things out.\n1700
VOC_JULIUS_LC8CUT2_2=Shit!\n1000
VOC_JULIUS_MODCAR_1=If you're still drivin' around in some hooptie you should kick it to Rim Jobs and trick out your car.  Don't worry though, if you put a lot of work into your ride and it gets taken out, you can always pick it up good as new at the mechanic.\n11500
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_1=Some of the Vice Kings have been hiding out near the waterfront.  Go in there and send those mother fuckers a message.\n4900
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_10=Dex found another Carnales drug lab.  Take it out.\n3800
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_11=I don't think the Carnales have gotten the message that the Saints are here to stay.  Tag up their refinery, I want those bitches to see our sign wherever they look.\n8900
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_12=Now that the Carnales' drug ring is hurtin' they've started to move to gun running.  They set up a weapons plant in an old steel factory.  Don't let their business get off the ground.\n11500
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_13=Head over to the docks, Troy got a tip that the Carnales called in a heavy hitter from out of town, make sure he never gets a chance to hook up with Lopez.\n8300
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_14=The Carnales have been hiding out inside an old store.  Until we clean that building out, there's no way we can hold down the Row.\n8000
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_15=The Carnales got in another big shipment.  There's too much product for us to take, so go to the docks and make sure they can't move any of it.\n7300
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_2=The Kings are keeping some of our boys locked up at the old police station, I want you to lead the jail break.\n5900
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_3=Some of Warren Williams' crew are gonna be meeting to discuss getting in on the drug trade.  Show those bitches why they shouldn't fuck with our business.\n7600
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_4=A bunch of King's bookies are meeting at a parking garage to discuss rigging games.  Don't let any of 'em walk away from the meeting.  No one fucks with my hockey game...\n9200
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_5=A lot of VKs have been seen goin' in and out of a grocery store.  I don't think those muthafuckas are buyin' 1% so go over there and figure out what's goin' on.\n8000
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_6=Price isn't gonna pull that bullshit he did on the highway again.  Go to his uncle's mansion and steal the prick's car.\n5700
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_7=Some of the Rollerz have a court date coming up, and Sharp is throwing paper and pussy at the jury to get them off.  Go to the apartment building they're sequestered at and dismiss some jurors.\n10700
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_8=Lin found a storage garage where the Rollerz stash some of their high performance cars.  Whaddya say we find out how good their insurance is?\n7800
VOC_JULIUS_STRONGHOLD_9=The Rollerz have been takin' a lot of interest in a receiving station in the truck yard.  Go and check it out, but be careful, who knows what they're up too.\n7600
VOC_JULIUS_VK4BPHONE1_1=Hey playa.  One of Johnny's crew got out of there in time and told me what went down.  If the cops are workin' for the Kings, you gotta get off the streets fast.  Hurry up and get back to the church.  We'll figure out a way to get Johnny back home.\n13000
VOC_Julius_VK5CUT1_1=It has to.  Sit down, son.\n3600
VOC_Julius_VK5CUT1_2=We got a way to rescue Johnny.\n2100
VOC_Julius_VK5CUT1_3=Every day, that bitch gets driven to the construction site in a limo, then sneaks off to get her freak on with Warren before she goes back home to Tony.  While she's busy suckin' cock, you deal with the chauffeur and take his place.  When she's done wiping her mouth, she'll have you drive her back.  Once you're at Tony's, its all up to you.\n15000
VOC_JULIUS_VK5PHONE1_1=Hey playa, we got a problem.  Some of Troy's crew didn't hear the plan, and decided they were going to hit Tanya when she was in her limo.  These are our boys.  I don't want them gettin' hurt.\n8800
VOC_Julius_VK7CUT1_1=Where's Gat?\n2200
VOC_Julius_VK7CUT1_2=Fuck!  Listen carefully, playa.  Benjamin King just called.  It seems like one of his boys got a big head and tried to take him out.  He's pinned down in the park right now and needs some help.  Now, what happens to King may not mean shit to you, but him and me, we got history.  I owe King from way back in the day, and he ain't gonna eat it if I can help it.  You're gonna go out there and save his ass, understand?\n21200
VOC_Julius_VK7CUT1_3=I ain't fuckin' around, playa, you bring King back here safe.  You feel me?\n5300
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_1=Lookin' good, Ben.\n1600
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_10=Now, you understand that this ain't just about Tanya, right?  We're finishing the whole crew.\n3700
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_11=So let's get to it.  Plan?\n2100
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_12=Alright playa, you're gonna be Mr. King's wheelman.\n2900
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_13=It's good to have you back, Benjamin.\n3500
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_2=Sorry about Anthony.\n1300
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_3=I don't think so, Benjamin.\n1400
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_4=I said no.  You're alive, we straight.  But the Vice Kings?  They're through.\n4600
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_5=You got a choice.  You can keep your fuckin' pride and die right now, or you can be a man and walk away.\n7500
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_6=What's it gonna be?\n2700
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_7=Fair enough.  Johnny.\n3900
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_8=My nigga.\n1000
VOC_Julius_VK8CUT1_9=Johnny, put the damn gun down.\n2000
VOC_JULIUS_WR6CUT1_1=Sup, playa?\n1200
VOC_JULIUS_WR6CUT1_2=Lin's been sayin' you're doin' a hell of a job when it comes to the Rollerz.  Keep it up.\n4500
VOC_JULIUS_WR6CUT1_3=That Lin?\n1600
VOC_JULIUS_WR6CUT1_4=Don't let me hold ya up; you know how the lady hates to be kept waiting.\n4000
VOC_JULIUS_WR8ATTACK_1=That's right, fuck 'em up!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8ATTACK_2=This is what you get muthafucka!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8ATTACK_3=We ain't lettin' you hurt the Row!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8ATTACK_4=You bitches better get the fuck outta my city!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CAR_1=It'd be crazy to charge that convoy head on.  We'll swing 'round behind 'em and take 'em out one at a time.\n6000
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CONVOYDAM_1=We're off to a good start.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CONVOYDAM_2=Keep it up and these bitches ain't gonna have a chance.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CONVOYDAM_3=That's right, make these muthafuckas pay for what they did to Lin.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_1=Did ya catch the news?  Looks like they found Lin's body floating in the river this morning.  Sorry, dawg.  I know you did everything you could.\n7300
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_2=Johnny's gonna take it pretty hard when he finds out, and you can bet yo' ass that he's gonna be callin' for blood.\n6000
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_21=Johnny's gonna take it pretty hard when he finds out, and you can bet yo' ass that he's gonna be callin' for blood.\n6000
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_22=We're not going to wait for them to hit us again, we're takin' the fight to the Rollerz.\n3400
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_3=What's going on?\n700
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_4=How much time we got?\n900
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT1_5=Aight, you're comin' with me.  We got some Rollerz to fuck up.\n4400
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT2_1=We're comin' up on Price.  Let's take that muthafucka out!\n2400
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT2_2=Nigga, you should buckle your seatbealt.\n2000
VOC_JULIUS_WR8CUT2_3=Just the same, one getting' away ain't bad.  Let's get outta here, playa.  We'll deal with Price once you get patched up.\n6600
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_1=Shit!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_10=Keep your head in the game man.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_11=Come on man, finish 'em off already.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_12=I thought you were gonna take care of these guys.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_13=What are you waitin' for?
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_14=Do somethin' before we both end up dead.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_2=Stay on 'em playa, we ain't givin' up!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_3=We ain't backin' down, understand me?!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_4=Hey playa, how 'bout you keep these assholes from shootin' my ride?!
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_5=Could you keep these bitches from shooting us?
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_6=You better pick it up, or we ain't gonna make it.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_7=Are you tryin' to get us killed?
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_8=We can't help the Row if we're dead.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8DAMAGE_9=Are you sleepin' over there?
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_1=Keep shootin' like that and they'll never make it to the Row.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_10=Good job, but it ain't over yet.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_2=The Rollerz never should've fucked with us.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_3=There's still more left.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_4=Don't get too cocky, we got a lot of work to do.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_5=Price isn't gonna have a chance.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_6=We're getting close.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_7=We almost got the sonofabitch.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_8=Let's not let Lin down.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8GRATPC_9=Keep it up, playa.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8OPEN_1=Let's get to the highway and stop that convoy.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8SPOT_1=Aight, let's take these bitches out.  You shoot, I'll drive.
VOC_JULIUS_WR8WIN_1=Now, let's finish off Price.
VOC_JULIUS_WR9CUT1_1=That was a hell of an explosion.  You okay, playa?\n3300
VOC_JULIUS_WR9CUT1_2=Oh, quit bein' a bitch.\n2600
VOC_JULIUS_WR9CUT1_3=We done and fucked the Rollerz hard.  They ain't got nothin' left.  There are a few loose ends, though, like who the fuck those buyers are Sharp was talkin' about.  I got a feelin' there's some shit goin' on we don't know about.  I'll catch ya later at the church.\n13900
VOC_JULIUS_WR9PHONE_1=Aight, he's pretty fucked up. I set up a present for ya at the next off ramp. Run that bitch off the road.
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_1=How much is the studio incident gonna set us back?\n3700
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_2=How.  Much.\n2900
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_3=Okay.  We got a few contractors that owe us, convince them to hook us up.  That takes care of building.  As for Aisha, throw together some memorial box set. People eat that shit up.  That should recoup some of our losses.  How's Tanya's side of things?\n15400
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_4=I'm not happy, Anthony.  You said she could handle it.\n3700
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_5=Everybody, calm the fuck down.  We ain't gonna start a war every time some muthafuckas act hard.\n5800
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_6=How did this happen?\n1100
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_7=What we need is for you to shut the fuck up, you feel me?\n5000
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_8=What?\n750
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_9=I'll have Monroe put some pressure on the Saints.  While they're distracted, it should be easy to take back what's ours.  Everything else is business as usual, understood?  Now, this meeting is over.\n14500
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_1=Damn good work, Tony.  I'll stop by after I pay a visit to Hughes.\n4500
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_2=We wait.\n1200
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_3= I mean, you're gonna sit your black ass down and wait cause I fuckin' said so.  Don't worry 'bout the one that got away, the 5-0 will take care of him.\n11200
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_4=Slow up, little nigga.\n2100
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_5=No.\n1000
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_6=I said no.  Don't make me say it a third time.  Warren my man, you got the music scene locked down.  I need you to bring in the chedder, not get shot 'cause you think you got somethin' to prove.\n11900
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_7=Maybe, but we ain't gonna find out.  We got the cops bustin' up 3rd Street for us, and we got Julius' lieutenant tied up in Anthony's condo.  Everything's goin' our way right now, so just chill.  Your time gonna come, Warren.  It just ain't happenin' now.\n16000
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_8=Understood?\n1500
VOC_King_VK6aCUT2_1=Don't worry about it.  Look, if it was one of mine I'll take care of it, but I'm tellin' ya, I don't care what colors they were wearing, it was that crew from Saint's Row I was tellin' you about.  No, I'm not makin' any excu-- I will.  Tell your wife I said hello.  Goodbye, Alderman.\n18000
VOC_King_VK6aCUT2_2=Wrong.  Workin' with them is what gives us power.\n3600
VOC_King_VK6aCUT2_3=Get the fuck outta my office.\n1900
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_1=Hello, hey it's good to hear fr-- what-- wait, wait, slowdown, what are you saying?  Look, our arrangement has been beneficial for both par-- Look, why don't we talk about this tonight over dinner.  I'm sure we can work this out, okay? Alright, see you tonight.  Goodbye.\n21700
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_10=You ain't hearin' me, son, I said--\n2600
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_11=What is this?\n1800
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_2=Who said you could come in here?\n1800
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_3=Do we now.\n1100
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_4=Keep talkin', little nigga...\n1800
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_5=I've told you before, we ain't gettin' into that shit.\n2100
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_6=You forget who you talkin' to.  My name is Benjamin muthafuckin' King.  I'm the man who took my crew from being a bunch of baby gangstas in Sunnyvale to being one of the most influential and feared forces in the god damn city.  You know how I did that?\n18700
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_7=I said, you know how I did that?\n2000
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_8=I did it by knowing when it was time to build, when it was time to watch, and when it was time to act.\n9300
VOC_King_VK6bCUT3_9=I'm through carrying your punk ass.  If I were you, I'd drop them damn flags and get the fuck on out of here before I erase your ass.\n7900
VOC_King_VK7Car_1=So you're the kid Julius sent, huh?
VOC_King_VK7Car_2=Warren's gotta be around here somewhere.
VOC_King_VK7Car_3=There he is, drop that bitch!
VOC_King_VK7Car_4=What you doin' son?  Don't let that bitch own you!
VOC_King_VK7Car_5=Keep it up, playa, and we might make it out of here
VOC_King_VK7Car_6=So long, Warren.  Thanks for your help, son.  Now you take me to Julius.\n6200
VOC_King_VK8Car_1=Quit fuckin' around and follow the plan!
VOC_King_VK8Car_2=What the hell's wrong with you?  Drive!
VOC_King_VK8Car_3=We should get outta here, son.
VOC_King_VK8Car_4=How 'bout you stop gettin' us shot?
VOC_King_VK8Car_5=I'm telling you, Julius ain't gonna be happy if you get both of us killed, son.\n4200
VOC_King_VK8Car_6=Way to go, son.  It's a shame Julius found you first.  We coulda owned this town.\n5300
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_1=So does Julius ever talk about growing up in Sunnyvale?
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_10=The fact is, once your in the game there only way you're getting out is if your dead or in jail.\n6500
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_2=What, you thought he was from the Row?  
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_3=The problem with burying the past is that you forget about it, you know what I'm sayin?\n4400
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_4=I bet Julius gave ya the whole "I don't care what flags they're flyin" speech, didn't he?\n4300
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_5=I wrote that shit years ago, and the mother fucker hasn't forgot it...\n4400
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_6=Your easy to talk to, you know that?  I don't gotta worry about you interrupting me or any of that shit...\n5800
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_7=That was Warrens problem...that mother fucker never knew when to shut up and listen...\n4800
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_8=Ya know that even if you wipe out the Vice Kings it ain't gonna be over, right?\n3800
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_9=There's always someone lookin' to take what you have...some punk who want's to make a name for himself, some girl you fucked and never called back...\n8400
VOC_King_VK8Cops_1=Yeah, I think that pissed 'em off.  Now let's lead 'em right to the police.\n6300
VOC_King_VK8Cops_2=Hard part's over.  Now we just have to sit back and let the cops do the work for us.\n5600
VOC_King_VK8Cops_3=Okay, we got their attention.  Time for the five-o to finish the job.
VOC_King_VK8Cops_4=This is the last crew, playa.  Let's finish this.
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_1=Been a long time, Jules.\n1900
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_10=I know where all them fools hang.  All we got to do is roll up in there, get their attention, then lead them to the cops.  They'll take care of the rest.\n8200
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_11=You ready for this, son?\n3300
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_12=Let's go.\n2900
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_2=That was business, let it go.\n2600
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_3=We kill Tanya and I get back to business.\n3500
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_4=What?\n800
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_5=Then kill me, quit wastin' my god damn time.\n3000
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_6=When did you get the balls, Jules?\n2600
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_7=I ain't walkin' away.\n1600
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_8=I ain't walkin' away until I deal with Tanya.\n4600
VOC_King_VK8CUT1_9=Yeah, I know.\n1200
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_1=You better pick it up, or we're both gonna be dead...
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_2=Quit fuckin' around and take care of this...
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_3=Are you gonna let these bitches take us out?
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_4=We ain't good to anyone dead...deal with this...
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_5=This whip ain't gonna make it unless you do your fuckin' job...
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_1=That's how we get it done!
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_2=You remind me of Julius...
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_3=Looks like you ain't a BG after all.
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_4=All business. I respect that.
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_5=I can see why Julius sends you to do his dirty work...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_1=Be more careful...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_2=The way you drive, I can't believe you were a threat to us...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_3=I shoulda let Gat put a bullet in my head, at least that would be quick...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_4=This ain't a street race, so how 'bout you be a little more careful?
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_5=This was a great idea, Ben...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_1=Come on man, that's unnessecary...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_2=Just focus on the Vice Kings, leave these people out of it.
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_3=You keep pullin' that shit, you're gonna end up in jail or in the ground...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_4=Yeah, it takes a big man to run somebody down...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_5=You gotta learn some discipline...
VOC_King_VK8Start_1=Aight, let's get this shit started right.  One of the safe houses is at the north end of town.\n6400
VOC_King_VK8Start_2=One down, three to go.  Some more VK's are holed up near the art museum.\n4900
VOC_King_VK8Start_3=So far, so good, playa.  Let's roll downtown and deal with the bitches there.\n5000
VOC_King_VK8Start_4=Last one.  Let's hope our luck holds out.
VOC_King_VK9Attack_1=Aw man, you bitches thought you could kill me!?
VOC_King_VK9Attack_2=You dumb muthafuckas never shoulda stepped!
VOC_King_VK9Attack_3=Come on, show daddy what ya got...
VOC_KING_VK9ATTACK_4=The Vice Kings are finished!
VOC_KING_VK9ATTACK_5=You think Tanya can protect you from me!?
VOC_KING_VK9ATTACK_6=You muthafuckas would've been nothing without me!
VOC_KING_VK9ATTACK_7=It ends here!
VOC_King_VK9Car_1=This is it, playa.  You sure you're ready?
VOC_King_VK9Car_2=Then you don't know me, son.
VOC_King_VK9Car_3=Your faith in me is very encouraging.
VOC_King_VK9Car_4=Okay, there it is.  The first thing we gotta do is clear a path to the elevator.\n5400
VOC_King_VK9Car_5=Then we kill Tanya.
VOC_KING_VK9COLLIDE_1=Watch it boy...
VOC_KING_VK9COLLIDE_2=Keep your cool, man...
VOC_KING_VK9COLLIDE_3=The fuck's your problem?
VOC_KING_VK9COLLIDE_4=Careful, this suits imported...
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_1=Don't ever worry 'bout me, baby-boy, cause I'm gonna handle mine.\n3400
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_2=I've smoked dozens of fools before.  I ain't addin' to the count unless I have to.\n5000
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_3=I said don't worry about it.\n2100
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_4=Ain't my crew, son.  That's why I'm here, remember?  So how 'bout you put your dick away, pick up your gun, and try to keep your knee away from the bullets.\n10900
VOC_King_VK9CUT2_1=The penthouse.\n1000
VOC_King_VK9Damage_1=Yo Gat, where the fuck are you?
VOC_King_VK9Damage_2=I need some help here!
VOC_KING_VK9DAMFIRE_1=None of you bitches got what it takes to stop me!
VOC_KING_VK9DAMFIRE_2=You got the balls to shoot me?
VOC_KING_VK9DAMFIRE_3=I'm from Sunnyvale, fool, you don't think I know how to take a bullet?
VOC_KING_VK9DAMFIRE_4=Listen up, muthafucka, you're gonna wish you stayed home...
VOC_KING_VK9DAMMEL_1=Oh, that was cute...
VOC_KING_VK9DAMMEL_2=How'd a weak-ass banger like you ever get in the gang?
VOC_KING_VK9DAMMEL_3=You don't know who you're fucking with right now...
VOC_KING_VK9DAMMEL_4=That the best you got baby gangsta?
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREATTK_1=I ain't takin' that from a bitch like you...
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREATTK_2=If Julius wanted me dead, he should've done it himself!
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREWARN_1=I'm on your side, remember?
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREWARN_2=You better knock that shit off, right now...
VOC_KING_VK9FLEE_1=You aren't gonna be able to run far enough...
VOC_KING_VK9FLEE_2=It's too late for that!
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_1=Good work son, I can see why Julius picked you...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_2=Don't get too cocky, there's more where that came from...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_3=Not bad...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_4=You're a little to good at this son...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_1=Tanya doesn't have a chance...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_2=You never shoulda turned on me!
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_3=Get's easier every time...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_4=Just like old times, huh...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_5=Still worried about me, Gat?
VOC_KING_VK9GRENADE_1=Take cover!
VOC_KING_VK9GRENADE_2=Look out!
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_1=Now you're gonna tell me what I wanna hear, you understand?
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_10=Thanks for your help...
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_2=Well Stefan also knows Tanya, so you better start talkin...
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_3=How do I get in the elevator?
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_4=Wrong answer...
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_5=I'd talk if I were you...my arm's getting a little tired...
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_6=Your bitch ass better stop talking in the third person or I'm gonna drop you on principle...\n4900
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_7=I'm running out of patience, Stefan...
VOC_KING_VK9INTERRO_8=Tell me how to get to Tanya...

VOC_KING_VK9RELOAD_1=Gat, how you holdin' up?
VOC_KING_VK9RELOAD_2=Don't you worry, there's more where that came from...
VOC_KING_VK9RELOAD_3=You bitches never shoulda stuck with Tanya...
VOC_KING_VK9RELOAD_4=If I were you, I'd run...
VOC_King_VK9Start_1=Come on, my ride's over here.
VOC_KING_VK9START_2=If we wanna get to Tanya we gotta get the code to the elevator...
VOC_KING_VK9START_3=She tells everything to her fashion consultant, he shouldn't be too hard to break.\n4200
VOC_KING_VK9START_4=Some Eurotrash mother fucker named Stefan.\n2500
VOC_KING_VK9TIMEOUT_1=I thought you were supposed to be hard, Gat.  Why we sitting around?
VOC_KING_VK9TIMEOUT_2=Come on, I wanna get this over with...
VOC_KING_WHOREMISSION_1=Warren Williams' court date is tomorrow, and the Vice Kings have been throwin' paper and pussy at the jury to convince them to let him off.  Get yo' ass to the whore house.  We got a jury to dismiss. 
VOC_Laura_DrugCUT_1=Hello.\n500
VOC_Laura_DrugCUT_2=I'm sorry I'm in a rush, I gotta pick my youngest up from school.  Do you have kids?  Who am I kidding you probably have something like 5.  Oh, nevermind.  Anyway, one of my colored friends was talking to me and she was saying that the real money isn't in piano lessons, it's in this thing called koma.  She set up some deals with my son's friends but I'm a little nervous about going into the city by myself because, well, I'm not poor. Could you be a dear and help me out? If you do I'll be sure to write you a nice check.\n30000
VOC_Limo_VK5Attack_1=What's going on?
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_1=Uh huh.\n1000
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_2=No one, I did it myself.\n2700
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_3=What is this, fuckin' third grade?\n2600
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_4=Forget it, I'll see ya tomorrow.\n2300
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_5=Assholes.\n1500
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_6=I swear to God, we're not going to be able to kill these bastards fast enough.\n5100
VOC_LIN_WR1CUT1_7=Aside from macho bullshit, I haven't heard much.  The only interesting news I got is that a shipment of high performance cars is coming in today.  It's not much, I know, so we're gonna make the best of it.  Jack the truck carrying the cars before it makes its delivery and take it to Samson.  He'll load up the cars with a few surprises, then finish the delivery.  Now get outta here before someone sees us.\n23300
VOC_LIN_WR1PHONE1_1=Hey, this is Lin.  Meet me at the arena parking lot, we gotta start making a move against the Rollerz.\n5300
VOC_LIN_WR2CUT1_1=Try not to look so conspicuous.\n3600
VOC_LIN_WR2CUT1_2=You did good, but I'm not through with you yet.  Those cars you stole have been rigged to blow once the engine reaches a high enough temperature.  I need you to make sure those cars get nice and hot.  There's a race going down in Chinatown tonight, and I think you should give them some tough competition.  I know these guys.  If you're in the lead for the final stretch, they're gonna hit the nitrous to blow past you.  When they do, boom.  As soon as those cars are wrecked, get the hell outta there.  You're no good to us dead.\n30100
VOC_LIN_WR2CUT1_3=Thanks for the dance.  Now hurry up, you got a race to win.\n5100
VOC_LIN_WR2PHONE1_1=Come to the nightclub. Samson's done workin' on those cars, and we gotta talk about what we're gonna do with 'em.\n6000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT1_1=Thanks.\n1000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT1_2=I tell ya, you and me are always making new friends. Things are moving too slow.  We gotta step it up.  I hear a guy named Joseph Price calls the shots.  I don't know much about him 'cept that he's friends with some mechanic named Donnie.   If we get in good with Price's crew, we'll always be one step a head of those fuckers.  Here's the plan.  Go and tear up Donnie's shop.  Right when you're about to finish off Price's buddy, I'll rush in and save the day.  Make it look good, but don't you dare mess up my car.  If we're lucky, Donnie will arrange a meet with Price.  Thanks for buying my tea.\n35600
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_1=Donnie, get down!\n2000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_2=What are you waitin' for? Get in!\n1700
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_3=I think you scratched my hood.\n2200
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_4=Mother fucker.\n2000
VOC_LIN_WR3CUT2_5=I'm Lin, and you're welcome.\n4400
VOC_LIN_WR3PHONE1_1=Meet me at the tea house in Chinatown.  I think I got a way to get in deeper with the Rollerz.\n5100
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_1=I'm Lin.\n1000
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_2=I'm the best racer that ever came out of Chinatown.\n2900
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_3=Cause I got tits.\n1800
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_4=Yeah, you did.\n1200
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT1_5=That was supposed to be funny?\n1800
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_1=Whatever, I think--\n1500
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_2=The 3rd Street Saints.\n2600
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_3=The buyers?\n1200
VOC_LIN_WR4CUT2_4=Hey, anything I can do to help.\n2400
VOC_LIN_WR4PHONE1_1=I'm in.  Donnie's setting up a meeting with the higher-ups of the Rollerz.  You should stop by and listen to what's being said.  I'll text you the address.\n8000
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_1=Don't talk to him like that.\n1600
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_2=It's not advice.\n1300
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_3=Listen up, you--\n600
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_4=(Sharp and Lin)Shut up, Donnie.\n1700
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_5=I was about to tell you to go fuck yourself.\n2500
VOC_LIN_WR5CUT1_6=Let's go, Donnie.\n1000
VOC_LIN_WR5PHONE1_1=Stopping those hijackings really fucked things up for the Rollerz.  They got a whole list of cars that they're plannin' on jackin'.  Make sure they can't find what they're looking for.\n9400
VOC_LIN_WR6CUT1_1=Hey, meet me at the pool hall.  The Rollerz are getting into something big.\n4700
VOC_LIN_WR6CUT1_2=Go fuck yourself.\n2000
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_1=Hey, I think we stopped moving.  Are you listening?  Are you even alive?  Say something!\n7200
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_2=Ow!  I'll take that as a yes.  Where the fuck's my lighter...\n4200
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_3=Stay calm, we're gonna get outta this.\n2500
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_4=Donnie listen to me, I swear to god...\n2200
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_5=Hey... stay... stay calm.  We're gonna get outta this.\n5600
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_6= I... I think I found my lighter.\n4900
VOC_LIN_WR7CUT_7=Did you hear that asshole Donnie?  He said I was his girl.\n6600
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_1=Oh my god!\n1800
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_2=I-- I-- was supposed to leave with Angelo.\n3100
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_3=Actually, they're this season's new--\n1600
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_4=That's not tr--\n1600
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_5=So what am I supposed to do now?\n2300
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_6=I have no place to go!\n1400
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_7=But you can't just leave me here!\n1400
VOC_LUZ_LC10CUT3_8=Can you at least tell me where Manuel is?\n3600
VOC_LUZ_LC5CUT2_1=Mmmmmmm....\n3000
VOC_LUZ_LC5CUT2_2=What about Manuel?\n1000
VOC_LUZ_LC5CUT2_3=What about Hector?\n1100
VOC_LUZ_LC7CUT2_1=Angelo, what are you doing?\n2000
VOC_LUZ_LC7CUT2_2=It looks like you're running off to get killed.\n2500
VOC_LUZ_LC7CUT2_3=Oh come on, you don't think Manuel is respon--\n2800
VOC_LUZ_LC7CUT2_4=He didn't kill Hector--\n2500
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_1=I've heard some nasty rumors, Hector.\n2200
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_2=That one of your drug labs was shut down.\n2900
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_3=And the drugs?\n1100
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_4=What about this gang from Saint's Row?\n2000
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_5=Your father would have killed them all by now.\n2200
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_6=I've noticed.\n3600
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_7=You're right.  Looks like everything is under control, Hector.  We'll talk about this more when the others arrive.\n8100
VOC_MANUEL_LC8CUT2_1=Mr. Little, I'm beginning to think we can do business.\n3300
VOC_MANUEL_LC8CUT2_2=So how exactly would you like to move forward?\n3200
VOC_MANUEL_LC8CUT2_3=Wait!\n1100
VOC_MANUEL_LC8CUT2_4=I know where he'll go.\n2700
VOC_MANUEL_LC8CUT2_6=That's where Angelo lives with his woman.  Consider this payment for your... act of good faith.\n6600
VOC_MANUEL_LC8CUT2_7=When you go over there, I'd appreciate it if you didn't kill the Senorita.  We'll be in touch .\n6900
VOC_Marcel_HitCUT_1=I'm glad you could make it...\n1000
VOC_Marcel_HitCUT_2=One of my niggas is in trouble and I need you to help.  He's got a big court case comin' up and the prosecutor has a whole line of witnesses that could put him away...needless to say, that ain't gonna happen.  I got a list of all the witnesses and I'll pay you for each one you can take out.   That straight with you?\n17000

Marshall Winslow is in his campaign bus right now, and he has an appointment with the northbound.

VOC_TROY_LC2HOTWIRETRUCK_2=It always looks so easy in the movies...
VOC_TROY_LC2HOTWIRETRUCK_3=Almost got it...
VOC_TROY_LC2GETTRUCK_1=Here's the plan:  get me to the truck so I can jack that baby.  Once I'm in, make sure I make it back to the Row in one piece.\n6400
VOC_TROY_LC2HIJACK_1=Get the fuck outta my truck...
VOC_TROY_LC2HIJACK_2=I'm in, now just make sure this thing gets back to the Row intact...\n2700
VOC_TROY_LC2HITOBJECT_1=I hope you take care of my truck better than you do your car...
VOC_TROY_LC2HITOBJECT_2=Well this is off to a great start...
VOC_TROY_LC2RUNOVER_1=Knock that shit off before a cop sees that...
VOC_TROY_LC2RUNOVER_2=Are you fuckin' crazy?
VOC_TROY_LC2SEETRUCK_1=Alright there's the truck...cover me while I get that heap running...\n2900
VOC_TROY_LC2START_1=You heard Dex, let's get that truck...
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKCHAT_1=Yo man, just between you and me I was fine with cleanin' out the Row, but getting into this drug shit ain't cool...someone should talk some sense into Julius...\n7500
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKCHAT_2=I know Lopez: once we steal from him he ain't gonna back off until  we're dead, or he is.\n5000
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_1=Start doing your fucking job, man!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_10=You gonna take care of mother fuckers or what?
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_2=Keep these guys off of me!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_3=If this truck doesn't make it back to the Row, Dex'll be pissed!\n3500
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_4=Help me out here!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_5=I don't know how much more this thing can take!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_6=Hey man, are you gonna take care of these guys, or what?
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_7=What are you doing?  Stop these guys!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_8=You gonna let me get shot up here?
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_9=This truck isn't doing so hot...
VOC_TROY_LC2GETSTRUCKRUNNING=God, I missed my calling... Okay, I got the truck started, let's get back to the Row.\n5200
VOC_TROY_LC2WIN_1=Well, we got the truck Dex wanted, now all we gotta do is figure out what the hell he needed it for...\n4800
VOC_TROY_LC4CUT1_1=Dex's bringing the truck around.  You know why he wanted that thing?\n4000
VOC_TROY_LC4CUT1_2=I did.\n1300
VOC_TROY_LC4CUT1_3=Not exactly the most original plan...\n2400
VOC_TROY_LC5CUT1_1=When it all goes down, the first place the Carnales is gonna look is right at the Colombians. They're gonna think they got fucked bad.  Aight. You should have no problem sneaking out in the confusion.\n8500
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_1=Yep.\n800
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_2=Yep.\n800
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_3=We've taken out one of the Carnales' legs.  We smoke this guy and they're crippled for good.\n3500
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_4= Yeah, well, I'd start with the strip clubs.\n1900
VOC_TROY_LC7ATTACK_1=I shoulda called in sick...
VOC_TROY_LC7ATTACK_2=They keep comin'!
VOC_TROY_LC7ATTACK_3=These muthafuckas made a big mistake.
VOC_TROY_LC7ATTACK_4=Let's show these bitches what the Saints can do!
VOC_TROY_LC7CUT1_1=Shit!\n1500
VOC_TROY_LC7CUT2_1=What?\n1000
VOC_TROY_LC7DAMAGE_1=Julius, don't worry, you're gonna be fine...
VOC_TROY_LC7DAMAGE_2=Shit, Julius, back off, okay?  You're no good to us dead.
VOC_TROY_LC7DAMAGE_3=Quit sittin' around, Julius needs our help.
VOC_TROY_LC7DAMAGE_4=Give Julius some cover!
VOC_TROY_LC8CUT1_1=So, how'd that meeting go with Julius?\n2300
VOC_TROY_LC8CUT1_2=Get the drugs back from the cops? How the fuck are we gonna do that?\n3400
VOC_TROY_LC8CUT1_3=Are you out of your fuckin' mind?  They'd lock the place down before you'd get anywhere.\n3600
VOC_TROY_LC8CUT1_4=No we don't.\n1400
VOC_TROY_LC8CUT1_5=If you load a car up with some explosives, you could blow a hole right into the evidence locker and never have to fire a shot.\n5500
VOC_TROY_LC8CUT1_6=That's what I'm sayin'.\n1100
VOC_TROY_LC9CUT1_10=Look, Dex--\n1800
VOC_TROY_LC9CUT1_9=I'm just sayin' it'd be nice to know.\n1800
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_1=Quit playin' around, we got work to do...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_2=Do you gotta do that?
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_3=Knock that shit off, this car's gotta be in good condition to win the race...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_4=The fuck you do that for?
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_5=Shit man, be more careful...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_6=Don't pull that shit in the Row...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_7=Quit fucking around...
VOC_TROY_RUNOVER_8=Come on, that shit ain't necessary...
VOC_TROY_STRONGHOLD_1=Rumor is an old liquor store is being used as a Carnales hide out...why don't you go over there and check it out?\n4600
VOC_TROY_WR2CARBLOWUP_1=That didn't look fun...
VOC_TROY_WR2CARBLOWUP_2=The kid needed thicker skin...
VOC_TROY_WR2CARBLOWUP_3=Lin doesn't fuck around, does she...
VOC_TROY_WR2CLOSER_1=You gotta get closer...
VOC_TROY_WR2CLOSER_2=Get me next to that fucker....
VOC_TROY_WR2CLOSER_3=Pull up to that Roller...
VOC_TROY_WR2COMPLETE_1=Good work man, all we can do now is sit tight and wait for Lin...\n4300
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_1=Yeah, I don't think they're too happy...
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_2=Let's get the hell outta here man!
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_3=We gotta get back to the Row!
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_4=Come on, shake these assholes!
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_5=Once we're back in the Row these bitches can't touch us...
VOC_TROY_WR2ESCAPE_6=That was too easy...
VOC_TROY_WR2PHONE_1=Hey, come to the church and pick me up, I wanna see if those trust fund babies can match their rep...\n4000
VOC_TROY_WR2RACE_1=Once the race starts, make sure you get me close to those assholes...\n3900
VOC_TROY_WR2RETURNROW_1=I think that pissed 'em off, we gotta get back to the Row...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_1=Come on, I thought you Rollerz knew how to race!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_10=Oh, come on, you can do better than that...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_11=I don't wanna hear any bitching when you gotta give me your parents' car...\n3300
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_12=See ya, chump...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_13=You didn't know who you were fucking with, did ya?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_14=You never had a chance...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_15=Don't even bother tryin' to catch up!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_16=I knew you Rollerz were all talk...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_17=You don't really think you can win, do you?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_18=You're outta your league, kid!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_19=You Rollerz are a fuckin' joke!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_2=That the best you got?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_20=Watching a movie about street racers doesn't make you a tuner, buddy!\n3500
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_3=Be sure to have your slip ready...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_4=Hey, be careful with my car...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_5=Tell ya what, you ask nicely and I'll let you wash my car on weekends...\n4500
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_6=You think you can beat us in that piece of shit?
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_7=Go back to the suburbs, you prep school muthafucka!
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_8=You shoulda stayed home...
VOC_TROY_WR2TAUNT_9=If I knew racing you chumps was this easy, I woulda took your slip months ago...\n4200
VOC_TROY_WR8CUT1_1=Yeah, well, we might have to rethink that plan.\n2700
VOC_TROY_WR8CUT1_2=Word is, every Roller that Price could find is headed this way.\n3400
VOC_TROY_WR8CUT1_3=Shit man, I don't know.  My man says they're movin' pretty fast.\n3000
TROY_WR2_INTRO_1=Hey man, let's get to the race...look, I don't care what Lin says, you get me next to those cars and I'll take care of the Rollerz, to hell with this lap-race bullshit.\n8500
TROY_LC2_STOPPED_1=Can you get your ass over here?
TROY_LC2_STOPPED_2=Where the hell are you man?
TROY_RESPECTCALL_1=What are you waiting for man, are you gonna represent your crew or not?\n4000
TROY_RESPECTCALL_2=Look man, the Saints ain't gonna be movin' up if you don't start earnin' us some respect...\n4000
TROY_RESPECTCALL_3=If you're rollin' with the Saints you can't just sit on your ass, you gotta get out there and earn some respect...\n5000
TROY_MISSIONCALL_1=Alright, we got a job for you...
TROY_MISSIONCALL_2=It's time we hit those other gangs...
TROY_MISSIONCALL_3=You ready to take some territory for us?
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_1=The incident?  I'm sorry.  I thought some muthafuckas blew up my shit.  I didn't realize it ain't no thang.\n6000
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_2=Including the loss of revenue from Aisha's death... I'd say we're talkin' millions.\n5800
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_3=That's what I'm talkin' about!  Are you gonna let these bitches disrespect us?\n3700
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_4=Thank you.\n1200
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_5=How the fuck you think it happened?  Look, we need to get together here and just--\n3800
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_6=Yeah...\n750
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_7=Yes, Mr. King.\n2900
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_1=So what do we do now?\n1500
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_2=Hold on, dawg, that muthafucka is still out there.  The fuck you mean, we wait?\n4600
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_3=Oh, so while you loungin', Tre Street keeps jackin' us.  That's great, that's... that's fuckin' brilliant.\n5700
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_4=Come on, King, this is some bullshit.  Let me get a crew together.  I could roll into the Row and drop all them bitches.  I'm tellin' you--\n7900
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_5=But Mr. King--\n400
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_6=I can do this!\n1200
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_7=Yeah; we straight.\n1100
VOC_Warren_VK6aCUT2_1=Great, now we got yo' cracka ass friends trippin'.  Like I said, fuckin' with City Hall is a waste of time.\n5100
VOC_Warren_VK6aCUT2_2=Yo, fuck that.  This is what gives us power.\n3700
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_1=See, this is what I'm talkin' about.\n2000
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_2=You've been puttin' yourself before the crew...\n2600
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_3=If you hadn't wasted our time stickin' your nose up them white boys' asses, we coulda owned the whole damn game by now.\n5800
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_4=And why the fuck not?  That's where the money is!  Man, if you got down with that shit back in the day, the Carnales woulda been ghosts right now.  But ya didn't, did ya?  You were too much of a pussy then, and you're to much of a pussy now.\n13900
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_5=FUCK!\n500
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_6=How, Mr. King?\n1500
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_7=I ain't goin' nowhere.\n2100
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_8=Yo fuck that, you ain't hearin' me.\n4200
VOC_Warren_VK6bCUT3_9=I built...I watched...and now I'm acting.\n4500
VOC_Warren_VK7Attack_1=You can't hide from me, King!
VOC_Warren_VK7Attack_2=Must be my lucky day, I get to kill both you bitches!
VOC_Warren_VK7Attack_3=After I kill you, no one's gonna step to EZ Money!
VOC_Warren_VK7Attack_4=You shoulda died in the boardroom, King.  It woulda saved us all some time!\n4300
VOC_Warren_VK7CUT1_1=The fuck you standin' 'round for?  Give me a fuckin' hand\n5000
VOC_Warren_VK7CUT1_2=Little nigga... I'll show King who the little nigga is, his muthafuckin' ass is mine. Hey yo, Tanya--what's goin' on?\n7500
VOC_Warren_VK7CUT1_3=Bitch, you better not miss, 'cause if--\n5000
VOC_WARREN_VK7CUT2_1=What's going on?
VOC_Warren_VK7Damage_1=What you doin' to my muthafuckin' ride?
VOC_WFCOP_LC5CUT2_1=No kiddin', with the amount of shit we confiscated we could've put Lopez away for the rest of his life.\n4700
VOC_WFCOP_LC5CUT2_2=Whaddya mean?\n900
VOC_WFYNG_LC5CUT1_1=This is the "McManus".  As you see, it's fully collapsible and comes in a stately black attache.  The 18" cryogenically treated stainless steel bull barrel gives this rifle a guaranteed accuracy of .2 minute of angle at 600 yds with match grade ammunition. With it's hand reamed chamber and match grade trigger, the "McManus" is designed for the marksman who wants to reach out and touch someone at a moments notice.\n25500
VOC_WFYNG_LC5CUT1_2=Lovely.  Would you like it gift wrapped?\n1200
VOC_WFYNG_LC5CUT1_3=Great, let me run this.\n2200
VOC_Will_PimpCUT_1=What's goin' on, bro?  Julius called and said you might be stoppin' by.  You lookin' for a little sumpin' sumpin'?  'Cause if so, I can let Peggy over there give you a ride...\n9000
VOC_Will_PimpCUT_2=Yeah, I didn't think so.  Look, brotha, I gotta be honest... I'm tryin' to get a business started here, but right now the only ho I got is so fugly, blind muthafuckas turn her down.  Now, if you could bring me back some of them fine bitches who are turnin' tricks for other pimps... I'd be able to start seein' some real money.  But I ain't askin' for somethin' for nothin'.  I mean, you help me out, I'll cut you in on what the bitches make, and I'll spread the word that the Saints are the real deal.\n23000
WINSLOW_3SS3BUS_1=Who the hell are you?
WINSLOW_3SS3BUS_2=I think there's been a mistake...
WINSLOW_3SS3BUS_3=Son, it's not to late to walk away from this...
WINSLOW_3SS3TRAIN_1=Why are you doin' this?  I'm from Saint's Row myself...
WINSLOW_3SS3TRAIN_2=OH JESUS!
VOC_WM3SS_LC3CUT1_1=You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me...\n2000
VOC_WM3SS_LC4CUT1_1=The Carnales ain't gonna know what hit 'em.\n2000
VOC_WM3SS_LC4CUT1_2=Hello, bitches!\n1300
VOC_WMLC_LC10CUT2_1=Uh... Angelo...\n2000
VOC_WMLC_LC10CUT2_2=What about Luz?\n1000
VOC_WMWR_WR1CUT1_1=Who tuned it for ya?\n1300
VOC_WMWR_WR1CUT1_2=No way, that underglow screams Ricky Liu.\n2100
VOC_WMWR_WR1CUT1_3=Dude, she totally wants you.\n3000
VOC_WMWR_WRCUT6_1=Sounds like the cops are comin', Mr. Sharp.\n2800
VOC_WMWR2_WR6CUT2_1=Sounds like the cops are comin', Mr. Sharp.\n2600
VOC_WMYNG_VK2CUT2_1=Running a little late today?\n1500
VOC_WMYNG_VK2CUT2_2=Want me to let 'em know you're in?\n1500
VOC_WMYNG_VK2CUT2_3=She's here, Mr. Williams.\n1500

VOC_WMWR2_IntroCUT_2=VK's are all over our sign!
 VOC_Rico_VanCut_1=Get outta here puta.\n1000
 VOC_Rico_VanCut_2=Not you man...\n1500
 VOC_Rico_VanCut_3=Sorry 'bout that, I got a little work for you.\n2500
 VOC_Rico_VanCut_4=Until I opened this club, I was a nobody.  My neighbors, my family...they didn't give a fuck about me.  But as soon as I had money, that all changed.  Suddenly everyone's my friend, and they all need favors.  Now, I ain't got a problem helpin' people out so long as they understand the consequences.  If they meet their end of the deal, it's no problem...but when they don't...that's when I need people like you, homes.  Go out there and show those pendajo's why they can't fuck with Rico Martinez.\n26000
VOC_AM3SS1_LC4CUT1_1=The Carnales ain't gonna know what hit 'em!\n1500
VOC_AM3SS1_LC4CUT1_2=Surprise, mother fuckers!\n1500
VOC_BF3SS1_LC3CUT1_2=3rd Street!\n1500
VOC_BM3SS1_LC4CUT1_1=Yeah!\n1500
VOC_Bruno_EscortCut_1=No fuckin' cameras!\n1000
VOC_Bruno_EscortCut_2=You thought you'd come here to get a story, but let me tell ya somethin', that ain't gonna happen.  Now get the hell out.\n5000
VOC_Bruno_EscortCut_3=Nice!  Thanks for saving me the trouble.  Tell ya what; we could use someone who's got no love for the press.  A bunch of big shots like to rent our girls for private parties, and there's nothing the media loves more than a sex scandal.  If you can make sure our girls can do their job without the press catching on, we'll pay you some serious cash.\n16000
VOC_Dennis_ChopCut_1=Tell Mr. Wong, don't worry...No, I said don't...Yes...I promise, everything is on time, we got nothing to worry about...Alright Good bye.\n12000
VOC_Dennis_ChopCut_2=I am so fucked.\n2000
VOC_Dennis_ChopCut_3=Sup man...\n2000
VOC_Dennis_ChopCut_4=Got any extra time on your hands?  This guy Wong put in a big order and I'm having a shitty time finding the cars he asked for.  If I don't deliver I'm as useful to him as a used condom.  What do you think?  Wanna help me find a few rides?\n12000
VOC_Garry_DemoCut_1=Are you crazy man?  The derby is about to start, if you're just standing around out here you could get really hurt...\n5500
VOC_Garry_DemoCut_2=Woo!\n1000
VOC_Garry_DemoCut_3=Don't mind my brother, he's just bein' a pussy.  Hop in a car man...there ain't nothin' better than smashin' cars for money.\n7000
VOC_HM3SS1_LC4CUT1_2=Hello, bitches!\n1500
VOC_Jenna_EscortCut_1=Hey darlin'.  Why don't you have a seat?\n2000
VOC_Jenna_EscortCut_2=I don't mean to pick on ya or anything, but most of the Saints go to places that are a little trashier...why do I got the feelin' you're looking for something other than pink?\n9500
VOC_Jenna_EscortCut_3=I guess you like to keep to yourself...that's good, I like discretion.  Celebrities look to me when they're in need of companionship.  They've all made their way into my little black book, and the list keeps growing.  These are powerful people, and if their hobbies were made public it would ruin their careers, to say nothing of my livelihood.  If you're up for it, I need a driver.  Simple job;  take the girl to the client, then give them enough time in private.\n30000
VOC_Lee_FraudCut_1=How many times do I have to explain it to you Miss Jackson, do not walk around without wearing your neck brace.  If someone catches you it could severely hurt our chances in court.  Just remember: the whiplash has caused excruciating, chronic pain.  You got that?  Good.  Have a good night Miss Jackson.\n17500
VOC_Lee_FraudCut_2=What can I do for you young man?  Are you looking to put together a case?  Before we can file a claim we need to find something wrong with you...you seem like an enterprising guy...I'm sure you can come up with something.\n10500
VOC_Libby_RaceCut_1=OK people, if you aren't at the line in five you won't be racing!\n3000
VOC_Libby_RaceCut_2=Look hun, if you wanna race today you better hurry up.  There's some real money to be made if ya got some skills.\n5500
VOC_Loreana_PimpCut_1=Wait wait wait wait wait, where you think you're going...It's been a while since a client came in here.  That's not to say my girls can't make you cum, it's just that I ain't got no girls to do it.  It's like this, I had the finest chica's on the block.  Then these fuckin' Padrotes come rollin' around, and all of a sudden I'm left with nothin' but stained sheets and some lube.  Look, I need my girls and I'm willing to pay whateva it takes to get 'em back.\n25000
VOC_Lorenzo_RaceCut_1=Hey man, what's up...look you didn't see any-\n4000
VOC_Lorenzo_RaceCut_2=Cool, that's straight...well, you know what I mean.  Look, I know of a couple races that are about to go down if you're interested...just to let you know the tuners  'round here don't play nice with guys they don't know so be careful out there.\n13000
VOC_LUZ_LC4CUT2_1=(Spanish)\n3000
VOC_Mary_VanCut_1=Come in.\n1000
VOC_Mary_VanCut_2=It's a pleasure to meet you, I'm Mary.  You may be wondering why a woman my age is running a place like this.  I'll spare you the details, but suffice to say, my ex husband didn't want me to have the club, so naturally I took it.  Now that we're divorced Nathaniel thinks he can run off with my trollop of a sister.  Sadly for my ex, this isn't the case.  Nathaniel owes me thousands of dollars in alimony, and I intend to collect.  Until he pays me, I want you to go and destroy as many of his holdings as you can...the more you hurt him, the sooner he'll pay.\n31500 
VOC_Miguel_ChopCut_1=What homes, never seen a man in a wheelchair before?\n3500
VOC_Miguel_ChopCut_2=Hey, you'd be on the rag 24-7 if some berry decided to show you what excessive force was all about.  It breaks down like this; my boostin' days are over, the police made sure of that.  But that don't mean I don't have an eye for what sells.
