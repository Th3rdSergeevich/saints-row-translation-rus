VOC_GAT_VKINTROCALL=Hey man, it's Gat...if you think clearin' out the Row was fun ,find me at the church... you're gonna love what I got planned for the Vice Kings...\n6500
# Kidnapped
# Woman Troubles
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_1=Take a seat, man.\n4300
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_2=So you're Julius' new boy huh? You don't look like much.  Then again, I don't look like I have an eight inch cock, so I guess we're both full of surprises.\n8800
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_3=The Vice Kings are named after one guy: Benjamin King.  That shit don't happen unless you're a professional or a bad ass, and in King's case, he's both.\n10800
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_4=Hold up, I gotta take this.  Aisha, what a pleasant fucking surprise.  Whoa, slow down.  Okay that's not slower, that's louder.  Shit, where's she headed?   Don't worry, I got this.\n17700
VOC_Dex_VK1CUT1_1=What's up?\n800
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_5=Some mother fucker's grabbed Aisha's sister right off the street.\n2700
VOC_Dex_VK1CUT1_2=Shit man, that's the sixth girl this month.  We know who's doing this?\n4400
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_6=Yeah, the Vice Kings.\n1800
VOC_DEX_VK1CUT1_3=No way man, kidnapping ain't King's style.\n2800
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_7=Maybe that slut Tanya is goin' behind King's back, don't know, don't fuckin' care.  Aisha said they were drivin' a yellow sedan.  Tail those bitches back to wherever they go and get those girls back.\n9900
VOC_Gat_VK1CUT1_8=Wait, hold up.  If you're bringin' that much ass home, you better have a big ride.
VOC_BFHO_VK1SPOT_1=The guy with the key went to Tee'N'Ay.
# Old Friends
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_1=God, you haven't changed at all, have you?\n2300
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_2=Not all of us have a couple million dollars to make changes.\n2600
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_2=It's always the same shit with you.\n1400
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_3=Oh, here we go again.\n1100
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_3=What did you want me to do?  Did you expect me not to take my shot?\n3100
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_4=No, I expected you to remember where you came from.\n2900
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_4=Oh, fuck you Johnny.\n1000
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_5=Fuck me?  Fuck you!  You're the one who ran off to be famous.  The only time you remember who we are is when you want something.\n6900
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_5=My sister was kidnapped!\n1600
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_6=And I brought her back didn't I?\n1200
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_6=No, he did.\n2200
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_7=Bullshit, I told him to do it.  No offense.\n4300
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_7=Look, if you're gonna help me, help me, but don't you dare try to hold it over me.\n4700
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_8=Fine.\n900
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_8=Fine.\n500
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_9=Fine.\n900
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_10=Relax man; I'd like you to meet Saint's Row's claim to fame.  This... is Aisha.  And tonight we're gonna kill her.\n7800
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_9=He's being melodramatic.  See, I'm signed with Kingdom Come Records.\n4000
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_11=And it's no secret that the label is owned by the Vice Kings.\n2600
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_10=But the real deal is that once you're in you can't get out.  They rip you off left and right, and they extort you to stay signed.  I've talked to Johnny and he said that you might be willing to help me.\n9700
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_12=Check it out: Eesh has a recording session in a few minutes.  That's when we make her disappear and give the Vice Kings a nice "fuck you" while we're at it.  I want you to take Aisha to her session, but on the way stop at the chop shop to have your ride loaded up with some C4.  Park the car at the studio and get the hell outta there.  Eesh, make sure someone sees you before you jump out.\n20500
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT1_11=Johnny, I really appreciate--\n1800
VOC_Gat_VK2CUT1_13=Whatever, I was gonna blow that place up anyway.\n2000
VOC_Samson_VK2Bomb_1=Alright man, you ain't got a lot of time, so hurry.  One more thing.  That shit in your car ain't exactly stable.  I wouldn't hit anything if I were you\n5500
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_1=Thank God.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_2=You had me worried there.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_3=Time to disappear.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_4=We made it.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_ATSTUDIO_5=That was close.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_1=Stay away from me!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_2=I told you I wasn't interested!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_3=Get away from me you creep!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_4=We're gonna die!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CARDAMAGE_5=I don't care if you are my biggest fan, I'm not gonna marry you!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_1=Are you new?  I don't remember you hanging around the Row.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_2=So does Johnny talk about me at all?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_3=None of this would have happened if I didn't sign on with Warren.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_4=Thanks for getting me out of this.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_CONVO_5=I never should've gotten mixed up with the Vice Kings.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_1=Oh my God!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_2=Are we dead?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_3=Be careful, we're sitting in a bomb!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_4=(screams)
VOC_AISHA_VK2_HITOBJECT_5=It didn't go off did it?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_1=Where are you goin'?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_2=Get in here and drive!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_3=We gotta get there before this thing explodes!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_4=Don't leave me here!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_PLAYEREXIT_5=Get back in here or I'm calling Johnny!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_1=It's just like my first date with Johnny.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_2=God, are they okay?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_3=I'm sure they're fine, just drive.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_4=You're crazier than Johnny!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_RUNOVER_5=This isn't happening.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_1=We gotta hurry!
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_2=We're running out of time.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_3=We gotta get there.
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_4=Are we gonna make it?
VOC_AISHA_VK2_TIMEWARN_5=If we don't get to the studio soon, we're dead!
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_1=So uh, you don't talk much do you?
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_2=Hey hey hey, slow down, we don't want to hit anything.
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_3=We're not gonna make it.  Why did I let Johnny talk me into this?
VOC_Aisha_VK2Car_4=Right on time.
# #1 Fan
VOC_Stalker_VK2Appear_1=Aisha, why haven't you called me back!\n3400
VOC_Aisha_VK2SeeStalker_1=Oh God, him again?\n1600
VOC_Stalker_VK2Attack_1=Hey you stay away from my girl!
VOC_Stalker_VK2Attack_2=She's mine, you understand me!
VOC_Stalker_VK2Damage_1=Nothing will keep me from her!
VOC_Stalker_VK2Damage_2=I won't let you have her!
VOC_Stalker_VK2Damage_3=Why are you making this difficult?
VOC_Stalker_VK2Die_1=It can't end like this, we were meant to be together...
VOC_Stalker_VK2Fire_1=Aisha, I need you!
VOC_Aisha_VK2Damage_1=For the last time, leave me alone!
VOC_Aisha_VK2Damage_2=This guy's been harassing me for weeks, he's crazy!
VOC_Aisha_VK2Damage_3=Oh God, oh God, oh God!
VOC_Aisha_VK2StalkerDies_1=I guess I don't need that restraining order anymore.
# The 7 Day Theory
VOC_WMYNG_VK2CUT2_1=Running a little late today?\n1500
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT2_1=Hey now, you gotta look good to sound good.\n2900
VOC_WMYNG_VK2CUT2_2=Want me to let 'em know you're in?\n1500
VOC_Aisha_VK2CUT2_2=Would you do that for me?\n2600
VOC_WMYNG_VK2CUT2_3=She's here, Mr. Williams.\n1500
# A Romantic Dinner
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_1=Look, I know you're supposed to be dead and all, but do you have to look this pissed?\n4300
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_1=Johnny, you said you'd take me out to dinner.\n2800
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_2=And here we are.\n1700
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_2=At Freckle Bitch's.\n1500
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_3=Where else would we go?\n1200
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_3=Someplace good?  Why couldn't you have taken me to Mikano's?\n4500
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_4=Aisha, it's not like... hey what's up?\n3300
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_5=Perfect timing.\n1000
VOC_Aisha_VK3aCUT1_4=You boys talk, I'll be right back.\n2700
VOC_Gat_VK3aCUT1_6=Whatever, she don't appreciate fine dining.  Now I've been talkin' to Eesh's sister.  Turns out Tanya's been fuckin' people in every sense of the word.  Not only is she blowin' King's bodyguard Big Tony, but she's fuckin' Warren Williams, their numbers guy, whenever Tony ain't lookin'.  Between Tony and Warren the only person she isn't leading around by their cock is King.  So I'm thinkin' we put the hurt on Tanya, we're fuckin' up the Vice Kings.  She's got an operation in Prawn Court, that's where we'll start.  Roll in there and put the murder on anyone you see, customers included.  Who wants to die for a blowjob right?  When you go for Tanya, be careful, she's probably got some muscle in there.\n39300
VOC_Gat_VK3aPhone1_1=So much for Tanya's hired help.  Now get your ass over to the whorehouse and drop that chickenhead.\n5700
# All the King's Men
VOC_BMVK1_VK3bCUT1_1=(murmur)
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_1=How much is the studio incident gonna set us back?\n3700
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_1=The incident?  I'm sorry.  I thought some muthafuckas blew up my shit.  I didn't realize it ain't no thang.\n6000
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_2=How.  Much.\n2900
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_2=Including the loss of revenue from Aisha's death... I'd say we're talkin' millions.\n5800
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_3=Okay.  We got a few contractors that owe us, convince them to hook us up.  That takes care of building.  As for Aisha, throw together some memorial box set. People eat that shit up.  That should recoup some of our losses.  How's Tanya's side of things?\n15400
VOC_Green_VK3bCUT1_1=Grip is short, Mr. King.\n1700
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_4=I'm not happy, Anthony.  You said she could handle it.\n3700
VOC_Green_VK3bCUT1_2=It's not her fault Mr. King, the Saints have been fuckin' with her.\n2700
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_3=That's what I'm talkin' about!  Are you gonna let these bitches disrespect us?\n3700
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_5=Everybody, calm the fuck down.  We ain't gonna start a war every time some muthafuckas act hard.\n5800
VOC_Tanya_VK3bCUT1_1=We gotta talk about the Saints.\n2200
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_4=Thank you.\n1200
VOC_Tanya_VK3bCUT1_2=Hey, baby...\n1800
VOC_Tanya_VK3bCUT1_3=They've taken Prawn Court.\n1500
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_6=How did this happen?\n1100
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_5=How the fuck you think it happened?  Look, we need to get together here and just--\n3800
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_7=What we need is for you to shut the fuck up, you feel me?\n5000
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_6=Yeah...\n750
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_8=What?\n750
VOC_Warren_VK3bCUT1_7=Yes, Mr. King.\n2900
VOC_King_VK3bCUT1_9=I'll have Monroe put some pressure on the Saints.  While they're distracted, it should be easy to take back what's ours.  Everything else is business as usual, understood?  Now, this meeting is over.\n14500
# Decisions, Decisions
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT1_1=Good thing you're here, I was about to leave without ya.  I don't think I'm feelin' the bat today.  This is always the hardest part for me... ya know, balancing stopping power with personal enjoyment.  Oooo, yeah, I'm feelin' this.  It ain't gonna be easy clearin' all those VKs outta the station, so I told my crew to meet us there.  Let's ride.\n25500
VOC_GAT_VK4ACHATTER_1=Tanya lucked out the last time you took out her brothel... this time the bitch is gonna get what's commin' to her...\n5000

VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_1=Come on muthafuckas, you can do better than that!
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_10=We're gonna take this place, just like we took the ho house!
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_11=The Saints are through bein' pushed around!
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_12=I'm sending all you fuckers home in a box!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_2=Don't stop now, we got more killin' to do.
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_3=Don't let that bitch get away!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_4=Fuck yeah!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_5=Get up so I can shoot you again!
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_6=This shit is too easy.
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_7=Ya hear that Tanya?  I'm gettin' closer.
VOC_Gat_VK4aAttack_8=Step on up boys and girls, everyone gets a turn.
VOC_GAT_VK4AATTACK_9=When are you bitches gonna get the message, stay out of Stillwater!
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_1=Let's hurry up, we don't want to miss the fun.
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_2=I hope you can keep up with me in there.
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_3=Hey, I can't kill anyone if I'm dead!
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_4=This is a car, not some bitch who forgot the safe word.
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_5=Did you see that fucker bounce?
VOC_Gat_VK4aCar_6=Let's save some of that for the station, k?

VOC_GAT_VK4ACOLLIDE_2=Would you mind not runnin into me?
VOC_GAT_VK4ACOLLIDE_3=Watch it, I'm jumpy enough as it is.
VOC_GAT_VK4ACOLLIDE_4=What's your problem man?
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_1=Oh, I like it when they play hard to get.
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_2=I'm fine, keep moving.
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_3=You think a couple bullets are gonna stop me?!
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_4=Mother fucker!
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_5=Hey man, are you gonna cover me or what?
VOC_Gat_VK4aDamage_6=A little help here would be nice!
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_1=Oh, I'm gonna take my time with you.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_2=Bitch, your day is about to get a whole lot worse.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_3=You couldn't take me out on your best day.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMFIRE_4=This is what Tanya's got for protection?  That girl is fucked.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_1=A swing like that, you wouldn't last five minutes in the Row.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_2=Motherfucker just hit me.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_3=See, that's just gonna piss me off.
VOC_GAT_VK4ADAMMEL_4=Becareful, somebody's gonna get hurt...

VOC_GAT_VK4AFLEE_2=Come on, who am I fighting, a Vice King or a ho?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_1=Man, I love your work.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_2=Not too shabby.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_3=Ya know, we should really do this more often.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATPC_4=You don't fuck around, do ya?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_1=It's been too long.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_2=I could do this all night.
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_3=Tanya, we're getting closer...
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_4=Anyone else think they're hard?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRATSELF_5=Who's next?
VOC_GAT_VK4AGRENADE_1=Shit!

VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_4=Just some rubbers, I was hopin' I could get some of Williams' sloppy seconds.\n5700
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_5=Guess I hit a nerve.\n1200
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_3=Do yourself a favor, stay down and shut the fuck up.  You 3rd Street mothafuckas think you so smart.  Well check this out, we ain't impressed. Hell, the only reason you got as far as you did was 'cause King let you.  We led you right to where we wanted you, and now the police are gonna finish your ass for good, just the way we planned.\n16700
VOC_Gat_VK4aCUT2_6=Well, that explains how your bitch lost Prawn Court.\n2600
VOC_Tanya_VK4aCUT2_3=Are you gonna let him talk about me like--\n1900
VOC_Green_VK4aCUT2_4=Don't worry baby, I got this.\n1800

VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_3= I mean, you're gonna sit your black ass down and wait cause I fuckin' said so.  Don't worry 'bout the one that got away, the 5-0 will take care of him.\n11200
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_3=Oh, so while you loungin', Tre Street keeps jackin' us.  That's great, that's... that's fuckin' brilliant.\n5700
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_4=Slow up, little nigga.\n2100
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_4=Come on, King, this is some bullshit.  Let me get a crew together.  I could roll into the Row and drop all them bitches.  I'm tellin' you--\n7900
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_5=No.\n1000
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_5=But Mr. King--\n400
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_6=I said no.  Don't make me say it a third time.  Warren my man, you got the music scene locked down.  I need you to bring in the chedder, not get shot 'cause you think you got somethin' to prove.\n11900
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_6=I can do this!\n1200
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_7=Maybe, but we ain't gonna find out.  We got the cops bustin' up 3rd Street for us, and we got Julius' lieutenant tied up in Anthony's condo.  Everything's goin' our way right now, so just chill.  Your time gonna come, Warren.  It just ain't happenin' now.\n16000
VOC_King_VK4bCUT1_8=Understood?\n1500
VOC_Warren_VK4bCUT1_7=Yeah; we straight.\n1100
VOC_JULIUS_VK4BPHONE1_1=Hey playa.  One of Johnny's crew got out of there in time and told me what went down.  If the cops are workin' for the Kings, you gotta get off the streets fast.  Hurry up and get back to the church.  We'll figure out a way to get Johnny back home.\n13000
# The Rescue
VOC_Aisha_VK5CUT1_1=You think it'll work?\n1300
VOC_Julius_VK5CUT1_1=It has to.  Sit down, son.\n3600
VOC_Julius_VK5CUT1_2=We got a way to rescue Johnny.\n2100
VOC_Dex_VK5CUT1_1=The shit Johnny said about Warren and Tanya really got to Tony.  Now, the only time she's allowed out of his sight is when she's checking on the rebuilding of the recording studio.\n7500
VOC_Julius_VK5CUT1_3=Every day, that bitch gets driven to the construction site in a limo, then sneaks off to get her freak on with Warren before she goes back home to Tony.  While she's busy suckin' cock, you deal with the chauffeur and take his place.  When she's done wiping her mouth, she'll have you drive her back.  Once you're at Tony's, its all up to you.\n15000
VOC_Aisha_VK5CUT1_2=Please bring Johnny back.  Just don't tell him I was worried.\n4400
VOC_JULIUS_VK5PHONE1_1=Hey playa, we got a problem.  Some of Troy's crew didn't hear the plan, and decided they were going to hit Tanya when she was in her limo.  These are our boys.  I don't want them gettin' hurt.\n8800

VOC_Limo_VK5Attack_1=What's going on?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_1=King better come over and pick up that Saint.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_10=That Heidi bitch has nothing on me.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_2=I can't believe Luz is still wearing last season's heels...
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_3=So Warren called me Aisha again today, can you believe that?\n4200
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_4=King is still blaming me for losing Prawn Court.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_5=Anthony better have killed Gat by the time I get home.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_6=King really should start listening to Warren.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_7=Warren and Anthony are both so clueless.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_8=King has to learn to get with the times.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Bitch_9=Sometimes I just want to say fuck it all and go to Hollywood, you know?\n3800
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_1=Well, I got some time to kill before Tony expects me back.  Might as well do a little shopping.\n5300
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_10=If you don't watch where you're driving, Tony's gonna break your face.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_11=Great, this is just what I needed...
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_12=Hey, I was putting on lipstick back here!
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_13=I swear to God, do that again and I will take your balls.

VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_21=Good job, remind me to give you a tip...
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_22=I better tell Tony about this.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_23=They probably didn't have anything to live for anyway.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_24=Not my problem.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_25=Get out of the way!
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_26=Great, I just had this thing washed.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_27=Fuck it, they can call their own ambulance.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_28=Was that a pot hole?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_29=Can't you do that on your own time?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_3=Stop by Friendly Fire, I'd like to pick something up for Tony.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_30=You really need a hobby.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_31=Don't stop, just keep driving...
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_32=Well, they should've been more careful.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_33=Tony just fixed this up...

VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_41=Could you not drive like a junkie?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_42=You're useless.  You're fucking useless.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_43=This is ridiculous, can't you just...drive through these people?\n4700
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_44=Why aren't we moving?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_45=I'm sorry, do I look like someone who waits in traffic?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_46=Can you do something about this?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_47=What am I paying you for?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_48=Drive the car, or I'll find somebody who will.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_49=This is taking too long...
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_5=Take me back to 707 Springfield.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_50=What the hell is this?
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_51=Don't just sit here, do something!
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_52=I don't have time for this...
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_6=Oh, he'll be fine...
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_7=They better not have dented the car.
VOC_Tanya_VK5Car_8=Do you think you could attract more attention?

VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_5=None.\n700
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_6=Your plan blows.\n1200
VOC_Dex_Vk6aCUT1_6=Hear me out, alright?  King's obviously got somethin' goin' on with the police, I'll figure that shit out.  In the meantime I want you two to go out and cause some havoc.  If we can turn the public's eye to the Kings then the police won't have a choice but to come down on them.\n14200
VOC_Gat_VK6aCUT1_7=Okay, so we go and do some damage.  How do the VKs get blamed?\n4100

VOC_Gat_VK6aPhone1_1=Let's start out light.  There's a bunch of newsstands downtown, go and tear those bastards apart.
VOC_Gat_VK6aPhone2_1=Not bad, time to step things up.  Kick it to the shopping center and firebomb every mothafuckin' store they got.
VOC_Gat_VK6aPhone3_1=Alright, one more stop and you can come home.  There's a new exibit outside the museum.  How 'bout you roll over there and show 'em how much you appreciate modern art.
VOC_GAT_VK6ARUNOVER_1=Ooo

# Subtlety is the Key

VOC_Dex_VK6bCUT1_4=This isn't gonna end well.\n1500
VOC_Gat_VK6bCUT1_4=Don't listen to the old woman.  I'll drive to where the cops are picking up protection money, you make 'em cease and desist with one of Tony's noisemakers.  If we make sure the only cops we hit are the one's working for King, people gonna start askin' questions, and the cops are gonna have no choice but come down on the VKs to save face.  Let's do this.\n17900

VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_6=Your easy to talk to, you know that?  I don't gotta worry about you interrupting me or any of that shit...\n5800
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_7=That was Warrens problem...that mother fucker never knew when to shut up and listen...\n4800
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_8=Ya know that even if you wipe out the Vice Kings it ain't gonna be over, right?\n3800
VOC_KING_VK8CHATTER_9=There's always someone lookin' to take what you have...some punk who want's to make a name for himself, some girl you fucked and never called back...\n8400
VOC_King_VK8Cops_1=Yeah, I think that pissed 'em off.  Now let's lead 'em right to the police.\n6300
VOC_King_VK8Cops_2=Hard part's over.  Now we just have to sit back and let the cops do the work for us.\n5600
VOC_King_VK8Cops_3=Okay, we got their attention.  Time for the five-o to finish the job.
VOC_King_VK8Cops_4=This is the last crew, playa.  Let's finish this.
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_1=You better pick it up, or we're both gonna be dead...
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_2=Quit fuckin' around and take care of this...
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_3=Are you gonna let these bitches take us out?
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_4=We ain't good to anyone dead...deal with this...
VOC_KING_VK8DAMAGE_5=This whip ain't gonna make it unless you do your fuckin' job...
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_1=That's how we get it done!
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_2=You remind me of Julius...
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_3=Looks like you ain't a BG after all.
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_4=All business. I respect that.
VOC_KING_VK8GRATPC_5=I can see why Julius sends you to do his dirty work...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_1=Be more careful...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_2=The way you drive, I can't believe you were a threat to us...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_3=I shoulda let Gat put a bullet in my head, at least that would be quick...
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_4=This ain't a street race, so how 'bout you be a little more careful?
VOC_KING_VK8HITOBJECT_5=This was a great idea, Ben...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_1=Come on man, that's unnessecary...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_2=Just focus on the Vice Kings, leave these people out of it.
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_3=You keep pullin' that shit, you're gonna end up in jail or in the ground...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_4=Yeah, it takes a big man to run somebody down...
VOC_KING_VK8RUNOVERPED_5=You gotta learn some discipline...
VOC_King_VK8Start_1=Aight, let's get this shit started right.  One of the safe houses is at the north end of town.\n6400
VOC_King_VK8Start_2=One down, three to go.  Some more VK's are holed up near the art museum.\n4900
VOC_King_VK8Start_3=So far, so good, playa.  Let's roll downtown and deal with the bitches there.\n5000
VOC_King_VK8Start_4=Last one.  Let's hope our luck holds out.
# Return of the King
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_1=I've been chattin' with King, and it looks like Tanya's takeover didn't sit well with everybody.  The Vice Kings are fighting amongst themselves; now's the time to take 'em out for good.  King said he was gonna come along, I hope he hasn't gone soft.\n12700
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_1=Don't ever worry 'bout me, baby-boy, cause I'm gonna handle mine.\n3400
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_2=All I'm sayin' is that since you got here you've been nothin' but talk.\n3400
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_2=I've smoked dozens of fools before.  I ain't addin' to the count unless I have to.\n5000
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_3=That's just fuckin' great.\n1500
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_3=I said don't worry about it.\n2100
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_4=I don't want you bitchin' out when you see your crew.\n2100
VOC_King_VK9CUT1_4=Ain't my crew, son.  That's why I'm here, remember?  So how 'bout you put your dick away, pick up your gun, and try to keep your knee away from the bullets.\n10900
VOC_Gat_VK9CUT1_5=You heard the cocky sonofabitch, let's roll.\n3600
VOC_GAT_VK9CUT5_1=You must be Stefan...\n1500

V  _GAT_VK9CUT5_1=You must be Stefan...
V  _GAT_VK9CUT5_2=Oh, I'm hopin' you won't come quietly.
VOC_STEFAN_VK9CUT5_1=Who do you think you are, barging into Stefan's boutique...\n3000

VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_6=I'm ending this here!
VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_7=King, this the best your crew's got?
VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_8=Oh I'm gonna enjoy this...
VOC_GAT_VK9ATTACK_9=You think you can keep up King?
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_1=King, the only person in this car I'm worried about is you.
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_2=That's why I'm worried.
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_3=I like to be positive.
VOC_Gat_VK9Car_4=What then?

VOC_Gat_VK9Damage_1=Where's my cover?
VOC_Gat_VK9Damage_2=King, you gonna do somethin', or just let me get shot?!
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_1=You really didn't want to do that.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_2=Hey, don't fuck up my shirt, I got a date tonight.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_3=Alright asshole, you wanna play rough?
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMFIRE_4=A shot like that, no wonder we're kickin' your ass.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_1=You got the balls to hit me you sonofabitch?
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_2=You're gonna have to do better than that.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_3=That was cute.
VOC_GAT_VK9DAMMEL_4=Don't really think that'll stop me, do you?

VOC_GAT_VK9FFIREWARN_2=What, you on Tanya's payroll?
VOC_GAT_VK9FLEE_1=You're not gonna make it out of here!
VOC_GAT_VK9FLEE_2=A bullet in the back is just as good as a bullet in the front.
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_1=You see that King, my boy knows how to get it done!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_2=Keep it up man!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_3=Tanya doesn't have a chance.
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATPC_4=You've come a long way, haven't you?
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_1=I'm just getting started.
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_2=Who else wants to play?
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_3=None of you mothafuckas can stop us!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_4=I'm comin' Tanya!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRATSELF_5=Now that's how ya get it done.

VOC_GAT_VK9GRENADE_2=Take cover!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRENADE_3=Get behind something!
VOC_GAT_VK9GRENADE_4=You didn't say they had grenades, King!
VOC_GAT_VK9KNOCKDOWN_1=I'll try to make it quick...
VOC_GAT_VK9KNOCKDOWN_2=Bitch, you never had a chance.
VOC_GAT_VK9POWERCUT_1=Yeah, well, it ain't gonna do 'em much good... people bleed just as well in the dark...
VOC_GAT_VK9RELOAD_1=King, cover me!
VOC_GAT_VK9RELOAD_2=I ain't gonna miss again...

VOC_KING_VK9ATTACK_7=It ends here!
VOC_King_VK9Car_1=This is it, playa.  You sure you're ready?
VOC_King_VK9Car_2=Then you don't know me, son.
VOC_King_VK9Car_3=Your faith in me is very encouraging.
VOC_King_VK9Car_4=Okay, there it is.  The first thing we gotta do is clear a path to the elevator.\n5400
VOC_King_VK9Car_5=Then we kill Tanya.

VOC_KING_VK9DAMMEL_4=That the best you got baby gangsta?
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREATTK_1=I ain't takin' that from a bitch like you...
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREATTK_2=If Julius wanted me dead, he should've done it himself!
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREWARN_1=I'm on your side, remember?
VOC_KING_VK9FFIREWARN_2=You better knock that shit off, right now...
VOC_KING_VK9FLEE_1=You aren't gonna be able to run far enough...
VOC_KING_VK9FLEE_2=It's too late for that!
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_1=Good work son, I can see why Julius picked you...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_2=Don't get too cocky, there's more where that came from...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_3=Not bad...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATPC_4=You're a little to good at this son...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_1=Tanya doesn't have a chance...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_2=You never shoulda turned on me!
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_3=Get's easier every time...
VOC_KING_VK9GRATSELF_4=Just like old times, huh...

VOC_KING_VK9RELOAD_4=If I were you, I'd run...
VOC_King_VK9Start_1=Come on, my ride's over here.
VOC_KING_VK9START_2=If we wanna get to Tanya we gotta get the code to the elevator...
VOC_KING_VK9START_3=She tells everything to her fashion consultant, he shouldn't be too hard to break.\n4200
VOC_KING_VK9START_4=Some Eurotrash mother fucker named Stefan.\n2500
VOC_KING_VK9TIMEOUT_1=I thought you were supposed to be hard, Gat.  Why we sitting around?

VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_2=I don't know anything!
VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_3=What are you doing? I don't like this, this makes me vibrate.
VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_4=Tanya tells me nothing, I just love her shoes...
VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_5=If you let me go I'll give you five percent off!
VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_6=Please don't hurt my face, I can't look common...\n5800
VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_7=You're nothing but a brute!
VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_8=Why do you hate the beautiful people?
VOC_STEFAN_VK9DANGLING_9=Stefan has done nothing to you!
VOC_Tanya_VK9Attack_1=You're finished, King.  The Vice Kings are mine!
VOC_Tanya_VK9Attack_2=After you're dead, I'm gonna burn Saint's Row to the ground!
VOC_Tanya_VK9Attack_3=I should have done this years ago!
VOC_Tanya_VK9Damage_1=Help!

VOC_KING_VK9CUT4_1=Oh, Tanya, do yourself a favor and die with some dignity.\n4100
VOC_GAT_VK9CUT4_1=That sucks for your car. We better get outta here. The cops will be here soon.\n5000
VOC_GAT_VK9CUT4_3=You comin' King?\n1900
VOC_KING_VK9CUT4_2=Alright, let's go.\n1700
VOC_GAT_VK9CUT4_4=Hey, I know what you told Julius an all, but why don't you stick around and roll with us, I'm sure he wouldn't mind havin' you around.\n7200
VOC_KING_VK9CUT4_3=Don't bet on that.\n2500
VOC_GAT_VK9CUT4_5=You think you can find a way back to the Row on your own?  Aisha... you know, the pussy calls.\n7450

# UNUSED
VOC_Gat_VKxPhone1_1=I don't know if it's quota time or what, but the cops are leaning hard on us.  Shit's too hot right now, I want you to get off the street... hold on.  What?  You're kiddin' me.  Those fucking cocksuckers!  Change of plans, it looks like the Kings are trying to get back Tanya's old digs as we speak.  Get your ass over there and help our boys.  You're the only backup they're gettin'.\n20500
VOC_Gat_VKxPhone1_2=I hope you're not cashed, we got more work to do.  Troy just got a tip that Tanya's setting up shop in the old Sunnyvale police station.  I talked to Julius, and he gave me the okay to go in with a crew.  I'm headin' back to the church to get strapped.  Come over when you're ready, but don't wait too long, we got some murderin' to do.\n16200
