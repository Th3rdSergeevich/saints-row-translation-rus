VOC_Samson_ChopCUT_3=Would you believe that four niggas got shot in that car?  That ride looks like I jacked it right off the lot.   My work's in fuckin' demand, son, and with you jackin' some extra cars for me, we could both be makin' some extra cheddar.  What you say?\n13000

VOC_Miguel_ChopCut_2=Hey, you'd be on the rag 24-7 if some berry decided to show you what excessive force was all about.  It breaks down like this; my boostin' days are over, the police made sure of that.  But that don't mean I don't have an eye for what sells.

# Business Partners (Drug Trafficking)
VOC_Marvin_DrugCUT_1=Come on in bro, I'm Marvin...\n1750

Now see that's good, 'cause my buyers need this shit like porn stars need cock, but stealin' junkies away from other dealers has a tendency to create bad feelings' if ya know what I'm sayin'.  You cover my ass when I'm slingin', and I'll make sure you see the green.\n21000

VOC_Tobias_DrugCUT_5=Hey what's up.  Sorry 'bout the mess.  Billy here thought it would be a good idea to skim off the top, and, well... let's just say he was wrong.  Are you lookin' for work?

# Suburban Bliss (Drug Trafficking)
VOC_Laura_DrugCUT_1=Hello.\n500
VOC_Laura_DrugCUT_2=I'm sorry I'm in a rush, I gotta pick my youngest up from school.  Do you have kids?  Who am I kidding you probably have something like 5.  Oh, nevermind.  Anyway, one of my colored friends was talking to me and she was saying that the real money isn't in piano lessons, it's in this thing called koma.  She set up some deals with my son's friends but I'm a little nervous about going into the city by myself because, well, I'm not poor. Could you be a dear and help me out? If you do I'll be sure to write you a nice check.\n30000
# Camera Shy (Escort)
VOC_BFStrp_EscortCut_1=Hey baby...\n500

VOC_Bruno_EscortCut_2=You thought you'd come here to get a story, but let me tell ya somethin', that ain't gonna happen.  Now get the hell out.\n5000
VOC_Razzi_EscortCUT_2=You're gonna wish you never did that, when my lawyers get through-\n3000
VOC_Bruno_EscortCut_3=Nice!  Thanks for saving me the trouble.  Tell ya what; we could use someone who's got no love for the press.  A bunch of big shots like to rent our girls for private parties, and there's nothing the media loves more than a sex scandal.  If you can make sure our girls can do their job without the press catching on, we'll pay you some serious cash.\n16000
# The No Touching Rule (Escort)
VOC_Jack_EscortCUT_1=Hey kid, how'd you like to make some quick cash.\n2500
VOC_Jack_EscortCUT_2=Evidently you aren't familiar with the no touching rule...\n3000
VOC_Jack_EscortCUT_3=You want the money, you do me a favor.  I got a couple of high-profile regulars who want a little more than a lap dance.  Now, normally they could go off to the VIP room, bust a nut and be on their way.  But these guys have special tastes they'd like to keep, uh, private.  Being caught with a hooker is bad enough.  Being caught with a fat hooker is even worse.  I got a girl waiting in a car out back, all you got to do is pick up the John and give the two of them some privacy.  Just make sure no one sees what's going on, alright?\n28000
# Class Act (Escort)

VOC_Jenna_EscortCut_3=I guess you like to keep to yourself...that's good, I like discretion.  Celebrities look to me when they're in need of companionship.  They've all made their way into my little black book, and the list keeps growing.  These are powerful people, and if their hobbies were made public it would ruin their careers, to say nothing of my livelihood.  If you're up for it, I need a driver.  Simple job;  take the girl to the client, then give them enough time in private.\n30000
# Start-Up Capital (Hijacking)
VOC_Sam_JackCut_1=It ain't much now playa, but I promise you, this place is gonna make me rich.\n5500
VOC_Sam_JackCut_2=Ever since I was kid I wanted to handle a rig, but when I tried to get a job truckin' they told me they don't hire kids from the ghetto.  Well fuck 'em, I'm gonna start my own company and the first thing I'm gonna do is put those bitches out of business.  All I'd need you to do is make sure a couple shipments get jacked.  Whatchu think?  Wanna be my first employee?\n18500
# Grease Monkey (Hijacking)

VOC_Phil_JackCut_2=Jesus, if you're scared of gettin' a little dirty you're in the wrong line of work buddy.  I hope you're not that big of a pussy when it comes to jacking shipments.\n7000
VOC_Phil_JackCut_3=Look, I only work with professionals,  if you say you got skills, I'll set you up with a target.  But if you're some punk who just likes to drive mommy's car fast, you can stay home.\n9000
# Short and Sweet (Hijacking)
VOC_Ralph_JackCut_1=Let's cut to the chase.  Names Ralph. My shipping company is fucked and I need help.

VOC_Deb_HitCut_4=Right now I'm willing to bet you're thinking one of two things.  Either your thinking, "There's no way I can kill someone who's done nothing to me" or you're thinking, "How am I gonna spend all that cash".  Let me tell you something sweetie, the second thought is gonna get you farther in this world.\n16500

# Doctor's Orders (Insurance Fraud)
VOC_Ray_FraudCut_1=Nice to meet you, I'm Doctor Raymond Gonzales.  I do a lot of consulting for this law firm, and my testimony in court has cost insurance companies millions.  Here's the way it works:  you throw yourself in harms way, I write a totally accurate insurance claim and we all walk away a hell of a lot richer.  Almost sounds too good to be true right?\n23000
# Legal Action (Insurance Fraud)

VOC_Seth_FraudCut_2=So, what can I do for ya?  Were you in a car accident?  Walking accident?  Coffee accident?  Self-inflicted stab wound accident?  Your injuries are worth money to both of us.  Babe, you stick with me and you're gonna be the richest sonofabitch in the ghetto.  Nice tie isn't it?\n16000
# Can Legal Lee Help You? (Insurance Fraud)
VOC_Lee_FraudCut_1=How many times do I have to explain it to you Miss Jackson, do not walk around without wearing your neck brace.  If someone catches you it could severely hurt our chances in court.  Just remember: the whiplash has caused excruciating, chronic pain.  You got that?  Good.  Have a good night Miss Jackson.\n17500
