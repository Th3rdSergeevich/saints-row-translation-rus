VOC_DEX_LCINTRO_PHONE=Sup it's Dex... takin' apart the Carnales ain't gonna be easy so whenever you're ready hit me up at the church.\n5500
# First Blood
VOC_DEX_LC1CUT1_1=Oh, hey man, didn't hear you come in.  Check this out.\n3700
VOC_DEX_LC1CUT1_2=The Carnales were the first organized gang in the city.  The way Julius tells it, they owned the whole damn town until Benjamin King stepped up against them.  Tell ya what though, I ain't worried about their history so much as I am the fact that A: the Lopez brothers are crazy muthafuckas, and B: Victor, their enforcer, survived a dozen VK drive-bys.\n21000
VOC_DEX_LC1CUT1_3=Sounds pretty bad right?  Now add in that the Carnales are backed by the largest drug cartel in the world, and I think you'll understand why we're gonna play this safe instead of pullin' a Johnny.  We cut off their income first, then we go for Hector.  Sound good?\n15000
VOC_DEX_LC1CUT1_4=That was a rhetorical question, but thanks for your support.\n3400
VOC_DEX_LC1CUT1_5=I got Troy goin' into Carnales territory to find out where their main plant is, but I already know where to score product.  They have labs here, here, and here.  Taking them out should distract the Carnales long enough for us to find out where they're making this shit.  Let's get to work.\n14400
# Troy and Dex
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_1=What if we came from here and here?\n1700
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_1=No, they'd just see it coming.  Cops try that shit all the time and it never works.\n4800
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_2=Shit, you're right.  Well, what should we do then?\n3600
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_2=Well we could--  You might want to hear this.\n3800
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_3=Aight.\n800
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_3=I got a lead on where the Los Carnales cut all their shit.\n2600
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_4=The Carnales.\n1300
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_4=Wha?\n500
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_5=Rio Grande River.  Jesus.\n1900
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_5=What the fuck?\n1600
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_6=It's not THE Los Carnales, it's just the Carnales.  Los means... fuck it.  Like I was sayin', we're not gonna raid the factory quite yet.\n8000
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_6=Why not?\n600
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_7=Cause I'm not a gun toting psychopath named Johnny Gat.\n3300
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_7=Fair enough.  So what's the plan?\n2000
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_8=One of my boys called and said they saw a truck with a heavy LC escort leavin' the factory district.  It's probably loaded with drugs, but that's just a bonus, our target is the truck itself.  I need it brought back to the Row in one piece; it's no good to us blown to shit.\n15400
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_8=What you need the truck for?\n1600
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_9=Let's just get the truck first, then I'll tell ya the rest of the plan.\n4200
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_10=I'm just sayin' it'd be nice to know.\n1800
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_10=Shit, Troy, what's with all the questions?  Why can't you be like my man over here?\n4000
VOC_TROY_LC2CUT1_9=Look, Dex--\n1800
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_11=Could you go get that truck?\n2200
VOC_DEX_LC2CUT1_12=See, was that so hard?\n2500
VOC_TROY_LC2ENTERTRUCK=Fuck...I knew I should've paid attention when they were teaching hotwiring...\n3600
VOC_TROY_LC2HOTWIRETRUCK_1=Alright, this should be the right wire...(sigh) or, maybe not...\n4200
VOC_TROY_LC2HOTWIRETRUCK_2=It always looks so easy in the movies...
VOC_TROY_LC2HOTWIRETRUCK_3=Almost got it...
VOC_TROY_LC2GETTRUCK_1=Here's the plan:  get me to the truck so I can jack that baby.  Once I'm in, make sure I make it back to the Row in one piece.\n6400
VOC_TROY_LC2HIJACK_1=Get the fuck outta my truck...
VOC_TROY_LC2HIJACK_2=I'm in, now just make sure this thing gets back to the Row intact...\n2700
VOC_TROY_LC2HITOBJECT_1=I hope you take care of my truck better than you do your car...
VOC_TROY_LC2HITOBJECT_2=Well this is off to a great start...
VOC_TROY_LC2RUNOVER_1=Knock that shit off before a cop sees that...
VOC_TROY_LC2RUNOVER_2=Are you fuckin' crazy?
VOC_TROY_LC2SEETRUCK_1=Alright there's the truck...cover me while I get that heap running...\n2900
VOC_TROY_LC2START_1=You heard Dex, let's get that truck...
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKCHAT_1=Yo man, just between you and me I was fine with cleanin' out the Row, but getting into this drug shit ain't cool...someone should talk some sense into Julius...\n7500
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKCHAT_2=I know Lopez: once we steal from him he ain't gonna back off until  we're dead, or he is.\n5000
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_1=Start doing your fucking job, man!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_10=You gonna take care of mother fuckers or what?
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_2=Keep these guys off of me!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_3=If this truck doesn't make it back to the Row, Dex'll be pissed!\n3500
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_4=Help me out here!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_5=I don't know how much more this thing can take!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_6=Hey man, are you gonna take care of these guys, or what?
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_7=What are you doing?  Stop these guys!
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_8=You gonna let me get shot up here?
VOC_TROY_LC2TRUCKDAM_9=This truck isn't doing so hot...
VOC_TROY_LC2GETSTRUCKRUNNING=God, I missed my calling... Okay, I got the truck started, let's get back to the Row.\n5200
VOC_TROY_LC2WIN_1=Well, we got the truck Dex wanted, now all we gotta do is figure out what the hell he needed it for...\n4800
TROY_LC2_STOPPED_1=Can you get your ass over here?
TROY_LC2_STOPPED_2=Where the hell are you man?
# Meeting the Lopez
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_1=Angelo, I need you to go to the lab tonight.  One of our shipments didn't arrive, and I want to make sure no one's skimming off the top.\n6900
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_1=No problem.\n1100
VOC_LUZ_LC2CUT2_1=Angelo, you promised we'd go shopping tonight.\n2750
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_2=Ah shit.  Hector, I told Luz I'd take her downtown.  Can Victor take care of--\n5000
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_2=Is Victor sitting at the table, Angelo?\n2500
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_3=Yes.\n730
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_3=So if I wanted Victor to handle it, I could have asked him, right?\n6100
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_4=Luz, we'll go out tomorrow.\n1500
VOC_LUZ_LC2CUT2_2=But Angelo--\n700
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_5=(Spanish)\n2000
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_4=Gracias.\n1000
VOC_MANUEL_LC2CUT2_1=You should be nicer to the lady...\n2000
VOC_VICTOR_LC2CUT2_1=(Spanish)\n4200
VOC_VICTOR_LC2CUT2_3=(Laughs)\n1500
VOC_LUZ_LC2CUT2_3=(Spanish)\n500
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_6=Luz, come on mama, don't be so sensitive.\n3500
VOC_LUZ_LC2CUT2_4=I'll be inside.\n1000
VOC_MANUEL_LC2CUT2_2=Senorita, a moment.  If Angelo is busy, I can take you out tonight.\n4700
VOC_LUZ_LC2CUT2_5=Mr. Orejuela, I couldn't--\n3000
VOC_MANUEL_LC2CUT2_3=Nonsense, it would be my pleasure.  Unless you have a problem with me entertaining the lady...\n5300
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_7=No, of course not.\n1500
VOC_MANUEL_LC2CUT2_4=Good.  I'll see you at eight.\n1900
VOC_MANUEL_LC2CUT2_5=That's a lotta woman you got there, Angelo\n2750
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_8=I know.\n1000
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_5=Eh, I always thought she was a bitch.\n1800
VOC_VICTOR_LC2CUT2_4=(Laughs)\n1300
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_6=Hold on.\n1000
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_13=(Spanish)\n3000
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_9=What is it?\n650
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_7=(Spanish)\n1600
VOC_MANUEL_LC2CUT2_6=That didn't sound encouraging.\n1500
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_8=Everything's fine.\n1200
VOC_MANUEL_LC2CUT2_7=Of course it is.  If you would excuse me, I'm going to check on the senorita...\n4800
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_10=(Spanish)\n3400
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_9=Angelo... you are my brother and I love you, but if you let your dick fuck things up with the Colombians I'm gonna cut it off.\n6500
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_11=Forgive me Hector.\n900
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_10=Don't let it happen again.\n1200
VOC_VICTOR_LC2CUT2_2=(Spanish)\n1100
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_11=Those pendejos in Saint's Row are the ones who took the shipment.  With the Colombians arriving, we can't show any weakness.\n5500
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_12=The Colombians are already here.\n1900
VOC_HECTOR_LC2CUT2_12=All the more reason to settle this now.  Victor, Angelo... gather your men together.  It's time to tear Saint's Row apart.\n6500
VOC_ANGELO_LC2CUT2_13=(laughs)
# Calm Before the Storm
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_1=Thanks, I'll swing by to pick that up.  Just the guy I was lookin' for.  Samson's got the truck all patched up, I'm gonna go--\n6800
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_1=We got a problem Dex.\n1600
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_2=What's goin' on?\n900
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_2=The Los Carnales are--\n1200
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_3=It's not THE Los Carnales, Jesus, what's wrong with you--\n3200
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_3=Dex, they're attacking the Row!\n1800
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_4=What happened?\n700
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_4=Angelo and his boys came outta no where, they fucked us up pretty hard, but it finally looked like we had Angelo pinned down...\n8100
VOC_VICTOR_LC3CUT1_1=(Hello there.)\n1000
VOC_WM3SS_LC3CUT1_1=You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me...\n2000
VOC_ANGELO_LC3CUT1_1=(Thanks, Victor.)\n1000
VOC_VICTOR_LC3CUT1_2=(No problem.)\n1000
VOC_ANGELO_LC3CUT1_2=Let's get back to Hector.\n1200
VOC_VICTOR_LC3CUT1_3=(Yeah, but first let's hit Freckle Bitch's on the way.)\n3000
VOC_ANGELO_LC3CUT1_3=Cool, I'm buyin'.\n6300
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_6=So they left?\n1000
VOC_BM3SS2_LC3CUT1_5=Angelo and Victor did, but there was a lot of LC still out there.\n4400
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_7=Alright, let's split up, the Row's a big place, and we gotta make sure we smoke all those muthafuckas.\n5800
VOC_DEX_LC3CUT1_5=Aw, you're kiddin' me.\n17100
# The Classics Never Die
VOC_TROY_LC4CUT1_1=Dex's bringing the truck around.  You know why he wanted that thing?\n4000
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_1=Shit Troy...\n1300
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_2=If you wanted to know all you had to do was ask.\n3300
VOC_TROY_LC4CUT1_2=I did.\n1300
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_3=Well, I guess you did, ain't that a bitch.  Now that we have things in the Row under control we can get back to the plan.  I had that truck you jacked fixed up good as new.  Load it up with a crew and drive it right into the Carnales production plant.  When you get inside, hop out and take the place over.\n17600
VOC_TROY_LC4CUT1_3=Not exactly the most original plan...\n2400
VOC_DEX_LC4CUT1_4=There's something to be said about the classics.  Remember what I said.  Take the place over, don't blow it to hell.  The more shit you blow up, the more shit we have to replace once we're runnin' it.\n11900
# Load Up!
VOC_AM3SS1_LC4CUT1_1=The Carnales ain't gonna know what hit 'em!\n1500
VOC_WM3SS_LC4CUT1_1=The Carnales ain't gonna know what hit 'em.\n2000
VOC_WM3SS1_LC4CUT1_1=Right on!\n1500
VOC_BM3SS1_LC4CUT1_1=Yeah!\n1500
VOC_HF3SS_LC4CUT1_1=(none)
# Hello, bitches!

# Everything's Under Control
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_1=Manuel, you worry too much, everything is under control.\n3700
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_1=I've heard some nasty rumors, Hector.\n2200
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_2=Like what?\n600
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_2=That one of your drug labs was shut down.\n2900
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_3=One of our couriers thought he could cut the shit out of his deliveries.  It looked like we were missing a lot of product, it really was just this pendejo.   Angelo took care of him.\n11300
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_3=And the drugs?\n1100
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_4=Found.\n900
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_4=What about this gang from Saint's Row?\n2000
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_5=A bunch of mulas, a nuisance, nothing more.\n2800
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_5=Your father would have killed them all by now.\n2200
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_6=I am not my father.\n1300
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_6=I've noticed.\n3600
VOC_ANGELO_LC4CUT2_1=Hey, don't you walk away from me, puta!\n2200
VOC_LUZ_LC4CUT2_1=(Spanish)\n3000
VOC_ANGELO_LC4CUT2_2=Woman, you listen to me--\n3200
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_7=ENOUGH!\n1000
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_8=(Spanish)\n5000
VOC_MANUEL_LC4CUT2_7=You're right.  Looks like everything is under control, Hector.  We'll talk about this more when the others arrive.\n8100
VOC_HECTOR_LC4CUT2_9=(yells in anger)
# Meet McManus
VOC_WFYNG_LC5CUT1_1=This is the "McManus".  As you see, it's fully collapsible and comes in a stately black attache.  The 18" cryogenically treated stainless steel bull barrel gives this rifle a guaranteed accuracy of .2 minute of angle at 600 yds with match grade ammunition. With it's hand reamed chamber and match grade trigger, the "McManus" is designed for the marksman who wants to reach out and touch someone at a moments notice.\n25500
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_1=I'll take it.\n1100
VOC_WFYNG_LC5CUT1_2=Lovely.  Would you like it gift wrapped?\n1200
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_2=No, that's okay.\n800
VOC_WFYNG_LC5CUT1_3=Great, let me run this.\n2200
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_3=Tight job on that lab, dawg.  We found a memo sayin' that Hector is meetin' with the Colombians tonight.  With the amount of firepower that's going to be there, just showing up and rushin' 'em would be suicide.  Take "McManus" here and get to the docks.  Find a nice tall building and wait.  When Hector makes his move with the Colombians, take your shot.\n20000
VOC_TROY_LC5CUT1_1=When it all goes down, the first place the Carnales is gonna look is right at the Colombians. They're gonna think they got fucked bad.  Aight. You should have no problem sneaking out in the confusion.\n8500
VOC_DEX_LC5CUT1_4=Just the same, I'd get the fuck out of there.  Who knows what could happen.\n4200
# Killing the Mood
VOC_BMCOP_LC5CUT2_1=That was a hell of a tip.\n1600
VOC_WFCOP_LC5CUT2_1=No kiddin', with the amount of shit we confiscated we could've put Lopez away for the rest of his life.\n4700
VOC_BMCOP_LC5CUT2_2=It don't matter, he got taken care of anyway.\n2500
VOC_WFCOP_LC5CUT2_2=Whaddya mean?\n900
VOC_BMCOP_LC5CUT2_3=Monroe's just happy Lopez is dead, as far as he's concerned this case is closed...hell if he found the guy who did this he'd probably send him a fruit basket.\n10000
VOC_LUZ_LC5CUT2_1=Mmmmmmm....\n3000
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_1=Hello.  Hey-hey Victor, I'm in the middle of something -- What?  WHAT!\n9100
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_2=Victor, listen to me very carefully.  I don't give a fuck about the drugs, I don't give a fuck about Orejuela--\n5400
VOC_LUZ_LC5CUT2_2=What about Manuel?\n1000
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_5=(Spanish)\n1000
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_3=Who did this to my brother?\n2500
VOC_LUZ_LC5CUT2_3=What about Hector?\n1100
VOC_ANGELO_LC5CUT2_4=LUZ! No mames! Okay, okay, you're right.  You deal with the Saints, I'll handle the Colombians.  If Manuel is behind this...(Spanish)\n12700
# The Colombian Connection
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_1=So this guy's the mouth piece for the Colombians huh?
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_1=Yep.\n800
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_2=And he's in town.\n1800
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_2=Yep.\n800
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_3=Interesting.\n1500
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_3=We've taken out one of the Carnales' legs.  We smoke this guy and they're crippled for good.\n3500
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_4=Yeah, and so are we.  We kill Orejuela, and the Colombians'll be all up our ass.  Let's figure out what his game is first, then we'll decide what to do.  You know where he is?\n9100
VOC_TROY_LC6CUT1_4= Yeah, well, I'd start with the strip clubs.\n1900
VOC_DEX_LC6CUT1_5=Cool.  Alright man, let's go buy this drug lord a lap dance.\n4400
VOC_DEX_LC6CHATTER_1=When we get to Manuel just let me do all the talkin' 'aight?  I'd hate for us to fuck things up with the Columbians because you said some crazy shit that pisses him off.\n8000
VOC_DEX_LC6CHATTER_2=With Hector taken out, his brother Angelo is probably callin' the shots... lucky for us he doesn't have his shit together... it'll probably take him a while before he's got the crew organized enough to make a move on us...\n9500
VOC_DEX_LC6CHATTER_3=If and when Angelo finally steps, he's gonna send Victor to do the job... now I know you think you're all badass and everything, but trust me Victor ain't no joke... you run into that asshole you make sure you got some serious back up.\n12000

VOC_DEX_LC6SPOT_1=Fuck the Colombian, we gotta get outta here!

VOC_DEX_LC7CUT1_1=Julius, I don't see what the big deal is.\n1900
VOC_JULIUS_LC7CUT1_1=The deal is that you went to talk to the Colombians without me.\n2900
VOC_DEX_LC7CUT1_2=We didn't even get to meet him Jules.\n2000
VOC_JULIUS_LC7CUT1_2=And don't call me Jules, you haven't earned it.\n2000
VOC_DEX_LC7CUT1_3=Fine.  Julius, you put me in charge of the Los Carnales.  Shit, now you got me sayin' it.\n5900
VOC_JULIUS_LC7CUT1_3=Dex, do your job, but don't think you're bigger than you are.   When it comes to the Colombians, you call me, understand?\n8100

VOC_DEX_LC8CUT1_1=He just got back from a sit-down with Orejuela and they came to an... interesting agreement:  If we can get back all the drugs the cops seized, the Colombians are willing to work with us exclusively.  We'll have a lock on the whole city.\n13100
