# Battlefield Promotion (All Clear)
VOC_Julius_FinalCUT1_1=We did it, playa. 3rd Street owns this town.   Now, that's not to say that shit didn't cost, and I ain't talkin' about what happened to Johnny's leg or losing Lin. Those two were soldiers, they knew the risk. Hell, Johnny gets off on it.  But we crushed a lot of families playa, and someday they're gonna holla at us. But believe me when I tell you, we did the right thing.  With the Rollerz wiped out, Benjamin gone, and the Colombians in our pocket,  there ain't gonna be a need for a gang war ever again. And in the end, that's gonna save a lot more lives than we took.  So relax, playa, you've earned yourself a break.  You've impressed the hell out of me son, and I've told the crew you're gonna be my right hand-  hold up, some berry just turned on his flashers.  Yeah, playa, I think I'm gonna have to call you back. This may take a while. \n50000
VOC_BM3S_FinalCUT1_1=Just say the word.\n1500
VOC_BM3SS2_FinalCUT1_1=Just say the word.\n1500
Chief Monroe=Chief Monroe
VOC_Monroe_3SS3Phone_1=This is Chief Monroe.  If you want Julius back, listen to what I've got to say.  Now, that stunt you pulled downtown with the rocket launcher cost my associates and I quite a bit of money.  Now, I may not be an honest man, but I'm a fair one.  So rather than turn Saint's Row into a parking lot, I'm going to let you work off what you owe me.  There's a mayoral campaign going on, and I want one of the candidates taken off the ballot.  Marshall Winslow is in his campaign bus right now, and he has an appointment with the northbound.  Park that bus on the train tracks tonight, or you'll find Julius' body floating in the river tomorrow.  Don't disappoint me.  Julius is counting on you.\n42500
WINSLOW_3SS3BUS_1=Who the hell are you?
WINSLOW_3SS3BUS_2=I think there's been a mistake...
WINSLOW_3SS3BUS_3=Son, it's not to late to walk away from this...
WINSLOW_3SS3TRAIN_1=Why are you doin' this?  I'm from Saint's Row myself...
WINSLOW_3SS3TRAIN_2=OH JESUS!
VOC_Winslow_3SS3_Bus_1=Who the hell are you?
VOC_Winslow_3SS3_Bus_2=I think there's been a mistake...
VOC_Winslow_3SS3_Bus_3=Son, it's not to late to walk away from this...
VOC_Winslow_3SS3_Train_1=Why are you doin' this?  I'm from Saint's Row myself...
VOC_Winslow_3SS3_Train_2=OH JESUS!
# A Little Community Service
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_1=Did you handle it?\n1000
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_2=Where the fuck is Julius?\n2500
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_1=Have you heard back from Monroe?\n1400
VOC_MONROE_3SS4CUT1_1=Nice work...but I don't think I can let Julius go until you do a little more community service ...we'll be in touch.\n7000
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_2=Looks like we wait.\n1300
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_3=Why?  So we can let this jag-off jerk us around?  Fuck that.\n3500
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_3=And what would you rather do?\n1700
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_4=You know exactly what I'd like to do.\n3000
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_4=Johnny, we're not blowing up City Hall.\n3100
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_5=I'm just sayin, it would solve a lot of problems.\n3400
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_5=What if they're keeping Julius there?\n1800
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_6=Alright, but there's gotta be a better plan than "let's be Monroe's bitches".\n4000
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_6=You're right, there is.  Marshall Winslow was a major public figure, and you can bet your ass that people would ask questions if the chief of police wasn't at his funeral.  I say we hit Monroe during the funeral procession.  That should show whoever he's working with that we're not fucking around.\n14600
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_7=You're sayin' we should assassinate the chief of police while he's at the funeral of the guy we just smashed.\n6500
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_7=Yeah.\n1200
VOC_Gat_3SS4CUT1_8=Don't tease me Dex.\n1300
VOC_Dex_3SS4CUT1_8=Let's fuckin' do it.\n1300
VOC_DEX_3SS4_DRIVING_1=We only get one chance at this, so we can't fuck this up.  Once we hit Monroe we better get out of there quick, the last thing we want is to make big scene.  Look, I'm gonna be honest with you dawg, once we hit the chief of police there's no turning back.  Sure, the motherfuckas that got Julius are gonna get a wake up call, but you gotta believe the po-po are gonna be on our ass.  I guess what I'm sayin' man is that if you wanna back out, no one is gonna blame you.  Well, Johnny might, but he's an asshole anyway so I wouldn't stress it.  Anyway, Johnny and I got this worked out so the hit should be smoother than Aisha's pussy.  McManus'll be waiting for us at a building along the procession route.  Take that bad boy and wait to take your shot.  We'll never get a chance like this again so let's not fuck it up.\n39930
VOC_Dex_3SS4Arrive_1=Johnny is set up across the street, he'll be giving us cover if things go bad after the hit.  Now let's get to the roof before mourners roll by.\n7000
VOC_Dex_3SS4Car_1=We only get one chance at this, so we can't fuck this up.  Once we hit Monroe we better get out of there quick, the last thing we want is to make big scene.\n7800
VOC_Dex_3SS4MissionEnd_1=They'll be scooping Monroe up for weeks.\n4000
VOC_Dex_3SS4MissionStart_1=Alright, let's get goin'.  Johnny's going to meet us there.
VOC_Dex_3SS4Sniper_1=Take this.  When the funeral procession comes into view, take out Monroe.  He'll be the one in the cop car.\n6300
VOC_Dex_3SS4Sniper_2=Okay, here comes the procession, just line up with the cop car and... aw shit, there's more than one.  Alright this ain't a problem, it'll just take a little more work to find out what car he's in.\n10100
VOC_Dex_3SS4Sniper_3=Fuck!  Well, they know we're here, no sense in being subtle.
VOC_DEX_TSS4_4GIVEN4GET=That takes care of that asshole, let's get to forgive and forget 'fore the cops get us...
VOC_DEX_TSS4_GATSTARTS=Fuck it, take all those cop cars our, Monroe's gotta be in one of 'em...
# Salting the Earth (The Final Cutscene)
VOC_HUGHES_RADIO1_2=Marshal may have been my competitor on the campaign trail, but away from the cameras he and I were close friends.  Like myself, Marshal had an unbridled love for this town, and would have given anything to make the life of its citizens better.  Sadly, a street gang named the Third Street Saints didn't share his world view.  In a violent instant the light he wished to shine on every man, woman, and child of Stilwater was snuffed out.  Not by natural causes, not by fate, but by the very people he dedicated his life to help.  Friends, when I first heard of Marshal's passing, like you, I was filled with sorrow.  But as I thought on this tragic circumstance my sorrow turned to outrage.  This wasn't just a murder, no.  This was an act of urban terrorism... a vile and malicious act that served no purpose other than to bring misery and fear to all who live here.  Well I for one am not afraid.  Our enemy has a name and a face, and rest assured they'll learn why justice wields a sword.  Thank you.
VOC_Hughes_3SS5Phone_1=Hello young man, this is Alderman Hughes.  That was quite a message you sent at Winslow's funeral...and trust me, I heard it loud and clear. Now I'd like to set one thing straight...it was Monroe's plan to strong arm the Saints; personally I've always thought you and I could have a much healthier relationship.  Now, we've had a rocky start, yes but why don't we fix that.  Come over to my fundraiser tonight, Julius will be there and between the three of us I'm sure we can work something out.\n26700
VOC_WMBNCR_FinalCUT2_1=Your guest is here, Mr. Hughes.\n2400
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_1=Thanks Steven, if you don't mind could you wait outside?\n4700
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_2=I'm Richard Hughes, it's a pleasure to meet the man who handed me the election.\n6900
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_3=No need to be modest, I'm serious.  There's no way I could have beaten Marshall Winslow, God rest his soul, but you made the impossible happen, and for that I can't thank you enough.\n11900
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_4=I mean, had Winslow been the only person killed, attention would have definitely been cast on me, but after that fireworks display you pulled at his funeral, it's become abundantly clear these horrible crimes were perpetrated by the 3rd Street Saints.\n14500
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_5=While before, people criticized my Saint's Row urban renewal plan, it is now being lauded.  See, until you came along, I was displacing poor people.  Now I'm destroying a hotbed of gang activity.  What can I say, the public is fickle... champagne?\n21000
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_6=As you get older you quickly learn that there are only two types of people in this world... race, money, gender, none of this matters.  At the end of the day you're either a winner or a loser.  Now, the sad truth about our situation is that in order for me to be a winner I have to level your neighborhood and salt the earth.\n20000
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_7=Hold on for a moment, Steven, could you come in here?\n3800
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_8=Where was I?  Oh yes, salting the earth.\n3900
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_9=I suppose I could try to pay you off, but really what's the point?  You'd just say no, or in your case, stand there looking intimidating, and we'd be right back where we started.  So I figured I'd cut the middle man and get right to the point.\n11800
VOC_PLAYER_FINALCUT2_1=Yo, could you speed this shit up?  I wanna go to Freckle Bitch's...\n3500
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_10=You're going to die here son, make no mistake about that... but if it makes it any easier on you, I'll be sure to thank you in my acceptance speech.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a party to attend.\n13400
# Explosion ensures.
# TROY: Julius, what the fuck was that?!
# JULIUS: It was the only way!
# TROY: I told you to speak with him, not to blow him up!
# JULIUS: Relax, Troy. The Saints are no more. Do not look for me.
