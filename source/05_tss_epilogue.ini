# Salting the Earth (The Final Cutscene)
VOC_Hughes_3SS5Phone_1=Hello young man, this is Alderman Hughes.  That was quite a message you sent at Winslow's funeral...and trust me, I heard it loud and clear. Now I'd like to set one thing straight...it was Monroe's plan to strong arm the Saints; personally I've always thought you and I could have a much healthier relationship.  Now, we've had a rocky start, yes but why don't we fix that.  Come over to my fundraiser tonight, Julius will be there and between the three of us I'm sure we can work something out.\n26700
VOC_WMBNCR_FinalCUT2_1=Your guest is here, Mr. Hughes.\n2400
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_1=Thanks Steven, if you don't mind could you wait outside?\n4700
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_2=I'm Richard Hughes, it's a pleasure to meet the man who handed me the election.\n6900
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_3=No need to be modest, I'm serious.  There's no way I could have beaten Marshall Winslow, God rest his soul, but you made the impossible happen, and for that I can't thank you enough.\n11900
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_4=I mean, had Winslow been the only person killed, attention would have definitely been cast on me, but after that fireworks display you pulled at his funeral, it's become abundantly clear these horrible crimes were perpetrated by the 3rd Street Saints.\n14500
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_5=While before, people criticized my Saint's Row urban renewal plan, it is now being lauded.  See, until you came along, I was displacing poor people.  Now I'm destroying a hotbed of gang activity.  What can I say, the public is fickle... champagne?\n21000
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_6=As you get older you quickly learn that there are only two types of people in this world... race, money, gender, none of this matters.  At the end of the day you're either a winner or a loser.  Now, the sad truth about our situation is that in order for me to be a winner I have to level your neighborhood and salt the earth.\n20000
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_7=Hold on for a moment, Steven, could you come in here?\n3800
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_8=Where was I?  Oh yes, salting the earth.\n3900
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_9=I suppose I could try to pay you off, but really what's the point?  You'd just say no, or in your case, stand there looking intimidating, and we'd be right back where we started.  So I figured I'd cut the middle man and get right to the point.\n11800
VOC_PLAYER_FINALCUT2_1=Yo, could you speed this shit up?  I wanna go to Freckle Bitch's...\n3500
VOC_Hughes_FinalCUT2_10=You're going to die here son, make no mistake about that... but if it makes it any easier on you, I'll be sure to thank you in my acceptance speech.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a party to attend.\n13400
# Explosion ensures.
# TROY: Julius, what the fuck was that?!
# JULIUS: It was the only way!
# TROY: I told you to speak with him, not to blow him up!
# JULIUS: Relax, Troy. The Saints are no more. Do not look for me.
