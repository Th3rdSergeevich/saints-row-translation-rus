HECTOR_1=Angelo, what are you doing?  Get over here!
HECTOR_2=Manuel, don't you ever mention my father again.
HECTOR_3=Alright, let's get this over with quickly, I don't like being in the open.
HECTOR_4=The sooner we get this shipment, the sooner Manuel will be out of our hair.
HECTOR_5=Have you seen Manuel?  He's not usually late.
HECTOR_6=Something isn't right.  Get the boys together, we're leaving.
HECTOR_7=Victor, it's Hector.  I need you here as soon as you can, I got a feeling something is about to go down.
MONROE_PRESSCONF_1=This is yet another example of the type of criminal behavior that we are working hard to eliminate. We have seized the ill gotten goods that these thugs were trying to slip into our city, and that's 2 or 3 million dollars worth of poison that won't be going into the arms and lungs of the youth of Stillwater. Now, while death is always tragic, Hector Lopez chose to live a life of crime, and he paid for that choice dearly.
MONROE_PRESSCONF_2=Hello.  Earlier today, an as of yet unidentified man was being pursued at high speeds by perpetrators who were later confirmed to be Vice Kings. Despite the stressful and dangerous nature of the situation, this citizen kept a level head and contacted the police immediately.  Once informed, we were able to respond swiftly and in doing so, were successful in the apprehension, detention, and in a few cases, termination of some of the most notorious criminals in this city.  Today a great victory was achieved in the war on crime, and if the citizens of Stilwater remain vigilant, we are sure to see many more.  Thank you for your time.
MONROE_PRESSCONF_3=We've identified a new cell of urban terrorists today. While they like to call themselves the 3rd Street Saints, we are calling them nothing more than common criminals.  At this time we know very little about them, other than that they exist, and they are the driving force behind the recent ramp up of gang violence that has plagued this city.
MONROE_PRESSCONF_4=We've budgeted more money this year for training,  surveillance, undercover officers and for more sophisticated body armor and weaponry. We plan to take the fight to them, rather than wait for them to attack the citizens of this great city.  If we act quickly and with steely determination, these 3rd Street Saints simply can't survive.
