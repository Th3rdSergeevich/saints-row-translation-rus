Julius and Troy of the 3rd Street Saints arrived just in time to get you out of danger. Julius informed you that the Row has had problems with rival gangs and invited you to stop by the abandoned church if you wanted to be part of the solution. After arriving at the 3rd Street Saints' church you were introduced and initiated, somewhat painfully, into the gang. Julius Little, the leader of the Saints, wants you to gain respect and help take back the Row.
MSN_TSS01A_STORY=Troy took you to shop for a gun and then asked you to help him take out some enemies in the Row. With the Vice Kings after you, he took you to Forgive and Forget to get the gang off your back. Once you were safe, Troy asked you to drop him off at Freckle Bitch's.
MSN_TSS02_STORY=After a phone call from Julius, you picked him and Troy up and drove them to the docks in Saint's Row, where a turf war between the Vice Kings, Los Carnales, and the Westside Rollerz was taking place. The three of you dropped all the rival gang members and secured 3rd Street's control over Saint's Row.
MSN_TSS02A_STORY=Julius believes that in order to hold the Row the three other major gangs in the city would have to be wiped out.  To that end, he divided the task among his trusted lieutenants. Dex was put in charge of dealing with the Carnales, Johnny Gat was put in charge of the Vice Kings, and Lin would be feeding information to the Saints regarding the Westside Rollerz. Julius told you to talk to those three if you wanted to help out.
MSN_TSS03_STORY=Police Chief Monroe called to tell you that the only way you can get Julius back is to do a little favor. Agreeing, you hijacked mayoral candidate Marshal Winslow's campaign bus and parked it on some train tracks, Winslow included. You hope Monroe will keep his word...

MSN_TSS05_STORY=The call from Alderman Hughes regarding the recent death of Police Chief Monroe isn't sitting well. Being the only gang left in town, perhaps Hughes thinks he can buy your loyalty. Or perhaps he just wants to threaten the Saints into leaving. Regardless of his motives, you've fought hard to run this city and nobody will stand in your way...
MSN_LC01_STORY=In a meeting with Dex at the church, he briefed you on Los Carnales, the powerful gang which dominates Stilwater's drug trade. He then laid out his plan to take them down: cut off the Carnales' income first, then move on their leader, Hector Lopez. Making the first move, you destroyed two of their drug labs, distracting the Carnales while Troy worked out the location of the main plant.
MSN_LC02_STORY=After Troy reported back with the location of the Carnales' main drug plant, Dex decided against a direct attack. Instead, Dex explained that he's heard about a truck leaving the factory district with a Carnales escort. At his request, you and Troy stole the truck and brought it back to the Row. You don't know exactly what Dex intends to do with the truck, but he must have a plan...
MSN_LC03_STORY=Dex was about to explain his plan when Los Carnales, led by Victor Rodriguez and Angelo Lopez, Hector's younger brother, launched a brutal surprise retaliation against the Row.

From your vantage point there, you assassinated Hector just as he was meeting with the drug lords, and disrupted their dealings.
MSN_LC06_STORY=The Saints received a tip that Manuel Orejuela , the mouthpiece for the Colombian drug lords, had arrived in Stilwater.  Rather than just take Manuel out, Dex decided to try and talk to him at a strip club in Carnales territory. After driving him to the club, you were ambushed by Victor, who sought to avenge Hector's death. Realizing the tip was a setup, you and Dex escaped back to the Row, denying Victor his revenge... for the moment.
MSN_LC07_STORY=Furious at the Saints for Hector's assassination, the fearless Carnales enforcer, Victor, led an all-out siege against the 3rd Street Saints' headquarters, and this time, he wasn't turning back. You and the other Saints withstood the assault, took out the attacking Carnales, and finally fed Victor his last bullet.
MSN_LC08_STORY=After meeting with Manuel Orejuela, Julius reached an agreement with the drug lords: if the Saints can recover the seized drugs from the police, the Colombians will work exclusively with the Saints. Acting on Troy's plan, you used a car bomb to blow open the walls of the police station's evidence locker, stole the drugs, and took them back to the row. Just as the Saints closed the deal with Manuel's cartel, however, Angelo made one last vain effort to take out the Saints. He escaped, but now the Saints know where he lives...
MSN_LC09_STORY=Following the latest failed attack on the church, you picked up Dex and went to pay Angelo a little visit, using the address given to the Saints by Manuel. After cornering him in a bloody fight, Angelo escaped through a window and took off in his car. You almost caught him after a hot pursuit, but he managed to lose you at the drawbridge. Dex isn't worried, though; Angelo hasn't got many places left to run.

MSN_VK06B_STORY=Dex found out that the reason the cops were working for the Vice Kings is that they were in on the Kings' protection rackets.  Johnny decided to hit both the Kings and the cops as they met to exchange the money, so that people would start asking questions and the cops would have to come down on the Vice Kings.
