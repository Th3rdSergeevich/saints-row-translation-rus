MP_BOR_INFO=Blinged Out Ride (BOR) is a team game in which the object of the game is to have the flashiest car.  At the start of the match, each team is given a car.  On the HUD the health for the car is displayed; as is its current level, how much money needs to be earned before you can upgrade your car, as well as the time remaining in the match.  As you kill rival gang members you will earn more money, as indicated on the HUD.  You can also earn money by picking up chains that appear on the street and then dropping them off at the chain drop-off location.  Once you have earned enough money to upgrade your car, drive it to the mechanic (which is indicated on the mini map).  Doing so will upgrade your car to the next level...but be careful, if the rival team destroys your car its level will drop one.  Once your car has been upgraded to level 4, drive it to the victory trigger field and leave it there for a minute to win.  If neither team has won the game by the time the counter reaches zero, the team with the best car wins.  If both teams have equal level cars, the game enters sudden death.  In sudden death, the 1st team to either destroy their opponents' car or level up their own; wins the match.  NOTE: While parked at your starting garage your car can not be destroyed, the only exception to this is A: once your car has reached level 4 it can always be destroyed, and B: once the game is in sudden death your car can be destroyed.  
MP_PTP_INFO=Protect Tha Pimp (PTP) is a team game played in rounds, in which one team needs to escort a pimp to safety, and the other team needs to stop them.  The pimp's team's goal is escort the pimp to a location that is indicated on the mini map within the time limit.   One player on the team is randomly chosen to be the pimp (as indicated by a pimp hat).  While playing the pimp, you are not allowed to carry any weapons and your stamina is reduced; however your pimp slap will kill anyone in one hit.  The Hitmen's team's goal is to simply kill the pimp or keep him from the exit until the time limit expires.  If either team achieves its goal the round is over.  The teams switch roles every couple of rounds.  The 1st team to win the predetermined number of rounds wins.
MP_BAC_INFO=Big Ass Chains (BAC) can either be played either as a team or individual game in which the goal is to score the most points by dropping off chains.  Whenever a player dies, they drop a chain.  If an opponent walks over the chain, that chain is added to their total (the number of chains held by a person is indicated by a number over their head).  If you walk over your own chain, or in a team game, if someone on the same team walks over the chain, the chain is removed, but it doesn't add to your total.  Once you have picked up an enemies chain, you can drop them off at the chain drop-off point (which is indicated on your mini map).  Once you drop off your chains, you score points based on how many chains you have on you at the time...the more chains you have (to a maximum of ten), the more points you score.  But be careful, if you die while holding multiple chains you will drop all of them.  The BAC HUD displays the point totals of the teams or players, the number of chains you're carrying, the amount of time before the drop-off point changes location, and the amount of time left in the match.  The team (or player) that reaches the score limit or that has the most points at the end of the time limit is the winner.
MP_GB_INFO=Gangsta Brawl (GB) can be played as either a team or individual game in which the goal is to kill as many of the opposing players as you can.  The GB HUD displays the score of whoever is in 1st place, your score, as well as the time remaining in the match.  If you are in first place, you will see your score on top and whoever is second below you.  The team or player with the highest score at the end of the match is the winner.
MP_COOP_TURB_INFO=Turbulence is a co-op mode.  In this mode the cops have ambushed you and your ally as you returned to Stilwater from an overseas drug deal.  You must fight your way out of the airport in order to escape.
MP_COOP_MOB_INFO=Mob Rule is a co-op mode.  In this mode you and your ally are transporting a drug shipment when a riot brakes out.  You need to take the boxes filled with drugs and get them to a fortified warehouse on the other end of town.

In Saints Row a players rank ranges from 1 to 50.\n\n TrueSkill is represented by a multicolor bar <img help_mp_trueskill>\n\n The first color indicates what ranks are below your skill level.\n\n The second color indicates what ranks are possibly within your skill level.\n\n The third color indicates what ranks are above your skill level.\n\n As you play more ranked matches, your TrueSkill Bar will change, narrowing the length of the second color as you beat (or are beaten by) your opponents, until your rank is clearly defined.\n\n Whenever you play a ranked match, you will automatically be placed in a match with people within your skill level.\n\n Each online mode has a unique TrueSkill Bar associated with it.
